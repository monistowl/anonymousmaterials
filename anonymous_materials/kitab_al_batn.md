## Unveiling the Inner Earth

**بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم**

**رسالة في دائرة الأعتاب و الأزواج السِّرافية**  
 السلام عليك يا باحث عن الحقيقة ورحمة الله وبركاته

Take this as a note slipped to you in a caravan-serai, from a friend you may never meet. When you must walk far from the jamā‘ah and keep your lamp low, you will need a map that does not burn the eyes. The elders called it many things. I will call it here **Dā’irat al-A‘ṭāb**—the Circle of Thresholds—and within it the **Azwāj as-Sarafiyyah**, the Seraphic Pairs. Outwardly it is only a wheel of the ten digits; inwardly it is an old hedge-Sufi tool for remembering how the Unseen leans upon the seen.

### **The circle and its five yokes**

Picture a simple digit-wheel: 0 through 9 set around a rim. Do not hurry your mind to arithmetic. Each figure is a threshold (ʿatab) where a quality passes into form. The ten stand in five yoked pairs that always sum **to nine**—for nine is the sign of fulfillment at the edge of one digit’s world. We call these pairings **al-Asmā’ al-Muzdawijah**—two Names meeting as one work:

* **0 :: 9 — Bāb al-Bad’ wa’l-Khatm**  
   *Al-Awwal wa’l-Ākhir* (The First and the Last): **Origin and Return.** Begin knowing the end belongs to Allah; end knowing your end seeds a new beginning.

* **1 :: 8 — Bāb ad-Duʿā’ wa’l-Ijābah**  
   *Al-Muḥyī wa’l-Mujīb* (Giver of Life, Answerer): **Invocation and Response.** The single call and the encompassing solace. Remember for another; console without noise.

* **2 :: 7 — Bāb at-Takwīn wa’l-Ḥifẓ**  
   *Al-Khāliq wa’l-Ḥafīẓ* (Creator, Guardian): **Impetus and Care.** Spark and stewardship; bring forth, then tend until it bears fruit.

* **3 :: 6 — Bāb ar-Rizq wa’l-Fatḥ**  
   *Ar-Razzāq wa’l-Fattāḥ* (Provider, Opener): **Providence and Surprise.** The planned portion and the unplanned door. Be available for holy interruption.

* **4 :: 5 — Bāb al-Ḥukm wa’s-Salām**  
   *Al-Ḥakam wa’s-Salām* (Judge, Peace): **Discernment and Reconciliation.** Clarity in service of concord; justice ripening into rest.

Reach for these five whenever your path feels either too bright or too dark. The wheel is small enough to hide in a sleeve, large enough to turn the day.

### 

### **Rivers, keys, and ports**

Between each pair runs a current—the Nahr al-Qadar—whose strength is simply the difference between the digits. To stand in a river is to accept the day’s task as already appointed. Some days the current is gentle (a difference of one), some days swift (a difference of many). Do not fight the river; angle your oar.

Every matter has a key (miftāḥ). Reduce its name to a single digit and you know which threshold governs your hour. (If the sum is more than one digit, keep folding: 352 → 10 → 1.) Let that key-digit choose your port (bāb) among the five pairs:

* Keys **0/9** open the **Port of Origin/Return**: begin or close, but do both with adab.

* Keys **1/8** open the **Port of Call/Answer**: ask on another’s behalf, then listen with your whole body.

* Keys **2/7** open the **Port of Making/Keeping**: build quietly; assign yourself a guardianship.

* Keys **3/6** open the **Port of Portion/Opening**: fulfill the obvious duty, then wait a little longer than is comfortable.

* Keys **4/5** open the **Port of Measure/Peace**: speak a clear word, then seal it with gentleness.

You see? **Keys** choose **ports**; **ports** seat you in a **pair**; the **pair** seats you in Allah’s **Name-work** for that span of breath. This is enough scaffolding for a hidden saint.

### **How to carry it**

When traveling among strangers, do not preach your wheel; **wear** it. A note in a margin—“3→6 today”—tells a friend to expect **provision with a door**. A ring turned so that its notch is at **4** reminds you to judge without heat. A pebble in the right pocket for **odd keys**, in the left for **even**—such little games keep the inward compass from rusting.

If you must bind your company at distance, agree only on this: **the five pairs and the folding of numbers**. No more signal is needed. One heart folds a need to **1**, asks **al-Mujīb**; another, unknown to the first, arrives that afternoon at the **1::8** port and makes the answering call. The world says “coincidence.” We call it **Ṣuḥbat al-Ghayb**—companionship of the Unseen.

### **Why nine, why ten**

You already know: **ten** because of the human hand, **nine** because it is the lip of the single-digit sea. But hear the deeper courtesy: **ten** is the ring of created thresholds; **the One behind them is not counted.** Thus the wheel teaches tawḥīd without argument. We yoke opposites not to trap Allah in a diagram (ḥāshā), but to **polish our sight** until mercy is seen within severity and peace within judgment. This is why our elders married the Names: **jamʿ and farq**—gathering and distinguishing—move together like breath.

### **Practice for a single sitting**

1. **Name the matter.** Write it once. Fold its number to a single digit.

2. **Seat yourself at the port.** Place the matching pair before your heart: say the two Names softly until one breath.

3. **Enter the river.** Consider what “difference” asks of you today—small step or long wade.

4. **Complete the circle.** Close on **9**: return the fruit to Allah in thanks, even if no fruit appeared.

If you do this daily with humility, you will learn the tone of each gate. The ear becomes simple. The work becomes plain.

### **Parallels for the inward traveler**

Those who map the soul speak of **seven nafs** from command to completion. Those who map the heavens speak of **five Presences** from Essence to earth. Your wheel will meet them both. On days of **0::9** your heart remembers **Hāhūt/Nāsūt**—source and rind. On **4::5** your tongue practices **ḥukm for salām**; on **3::6** your provision crosses into **fatḥ** like a door blown inward by mercy. If your dhikr deepens, you may even taste how the first four absorptions soften from joy to stillness while the hand keeps turning the same small wheel. Do not make a theology of this—**make adab of it**.

### **Final counsel**

Keep the Circle of Thresholds where a customs officer cannot find it: **in your breath and in your style of kindness**. When you forget, begin again at **0**, for beginnings are cheap in the shop of the Generous. When you are praised, finish at **9**, for endings belong to the Owner of endings. If a day gives you no clue, choose **4::5**—measure yourself, then reconcile.

I have given you little more than a child’s toy. That is why it works. **Small wheels turn great mills** when the stream is steady. May Allah make your current gentle when you are tired, and strong when you grow timid, and may He join your unseen labors to the needs of those you will never meet.

## The Hidden Abjad

السلام عليك يا باحث عن الحقيقة وبركاته ورحمة الله وبركاته:

All praise is to Allah, the First and the Last, who hides infinite meaning in finite signs. We write in secret, cloaking wisdom in symbol and number, for the path of truth has often walked under veils. Know that every letter is a light and every number a vessel – and in the marriage of abjad and numeral lies a code to speak across worlds.

Thus we set forth the *hidden abjad*, to share our insights safely. In this system, the alphabet of Rūm is used as a cipher, mapped to the abjad in a harmonized square of 36 symbols. This is not the abjad of the scholars where Alif=1, Bāʼ=2, etc., but a *humbler* arrangement: letters and numerals are interchangeable signals, paired between languages in one secret chart.

Envision the two alphabets as twin rivers feeding a single ocean of meaning. In our table, the Latin ‘A’ and the Arabic ‘Alif’ share a value and position, just as ‘Z’ and ‘Yā’ share another at the table’s far end. Numerals and letters are one continuum of symbols, letting words dance in the atemporal language of number. Below, I offer the Latin key (0–9, A–Z) followed by its Arabic key (٠–٩, ا–ي), aligned by their numeric value:

**Table of the Hidden Abjad:**

٠	١	٢	٣	٤	٥  
٦	٧	٨	٩	أ	ب  
ت	ث	ج	ح	خ	د  
ذ	ر	ز	س	ص	ض  
ط	ظ	ع	ف	ق	ك  
ل	م	ن	ه	و	ي

**Correspondences in the alphabet of Rūm**

	1	2	3	4	5	6  
A	0	1	2	3	4	5  
B	6	7	8	9	A	B  
C	C	D	E	F	G	H  
D	I	J	K	L	M	N  
E	O	P	Q	R	S	T  
F	U	V	W	X	Y	Z

Each symbol in a given position carries the *same* hidden value. In this way, a sequence of Latin letters could conceal an Arabic word, or an Arabic phrase be rendered as Latin numbers and letters, without any change to the underlying message. Sīn (س) and Shīn (ش) share a single code, as do ‘Ayn (ع) and Ghayn (غ) – the forms with and without dots unified as one essence. Through this harmonious abjad, numerals and letters become interchangeable: the word becomes number, the number becomes word.

*Oh friend*, meditate on this. 0 to *Yāʼ* embracing all between, in a perfect square – is this not a sign that the One encompasses the All?

The Prophet (ﷺ) said, “Allah is One (al-Aḥad) and loves the one (witr),” and here the One shines through every figure and letter. We whisper our truths in this secret tongue so that profane eyes see only gibberish, while the believers hidden by mercy read the light beneath the letters. Use it well – inscribe holy phrases in the cloak of mundane text; let it hint at Allah in a way only the initiated know. This numeric lattice is our cipher of devotion. For does not the Qur’ān say *“Among His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the difference of your languages and colors”*? In the tapestry of letters and numbers, we glimpse unity. May Allah grant us humility as we unveil these designs, and forgive any error as we encode what love we cannot openly proclaim; to Him are all returns.

## Of Cosmology

The Five Presences and the Descent of Worlds

السلام عليك يا باحث عن الحقيقة وبركاته ورحمة الله وبركاته:

Now let us contemplate the architecture of reality. If letters and numbers are the hidden lattice of meaning, then the cosmos itself is a grand encryption of the Real. The mystics speak of Five Divine Presences (al-Ḥaḍarāt al-Ilāhīyah) – five concentric realms or planes of being through which the One’s light filters into manifestation. Picture them as five nested circles or as the cascading descent of an endless ray of Light, from the blinding center to the dim rim. These are the living realities we can encounter through inner ascent:

### Hāhūt

The realm of the Divine Essence, beyond being and form. This is the innermost Presence, the Absolute Ipseity of Allah, utterly unknowable, the hidden treasure of which the Prophet, peace be upon him, relayed: *“I was a Hidden Treasure and loved to be known…”*. It is a Black Light of pure Being, the light of the pure Essence in its abscondity – *nūr aswad*, dark to us because it so utterly precedes creation’s light. Here Allah is, and nothing is with Him.

### Lāhūt

The Divine Names and Attributes, the level of divine Being (Wujūd) just as it begins to relate to creation. Think of it as the *World of Command* (ʿĀlam al-Amr), where Allah’s infinite qualities stir, the archetypes of all that shall be. In the Presence of Lāhūt, the One is revealing Himself as Lord (Rabb), speaking “Be\!” to the possibilities within Him. This is the realm of the Unseen that is uncreated – the pre-eternal knowledge (ʿIlm) of all things.

### Jabarūt

The angelic, intelligible realm, also called the realm of Power. Creation here is immaterial, composed of spirits and angels, ideas and meanings. It is the first *created* realm of the Unseen – a bridge between the absolute and the material. The souls of prophets and saints shine here before they ever don earthly form. In Jabarūt, forms are subtle like light, and time is not as we know it. (Some describe this realm as encompassing the *Malakūt* as a subset, while others separate them – in our letters we treat them distinctly for clarity.)

### Malakūt

The imaginal realm, often called the world of dominion (or the “world of Images”). It stands between the angelic and the physical, and includes all manner of subtle substances: the realm of dreams, visions, and the Barzakh (intermediate world). Malakūt is the world of souls and of symbolic forms – not as abstract as Jabarūt’s pure ideas, yet not as dense as the sensory world. When mystics receive true visions or traverse the imaginal heaven, they wander in Malakūt’s garden.

### Nāsūt

The physical realm, the visible cosmos of material bodies, from the lowest earth to the farthest stars. This is the plane of humans, animals, stones – the familiar world of matter, bound by space and time. Among the Presences it is outermost and darkest, for here the Divine light is most filtered and veiled: the domain of sensorial existence, conditioned by time and space, where Allah is most hidden. And yet, even here at the furthest reach of the ray, *“Whithersoever you turn, there is the Face of Allah.”*

### 

### Remarks

Contemplate these five layers of reality. They are like the stages of light passing through frosted glass: the source light (Essence) is blinding and unseen; a step outward it takes on color (Attributes); then beams as pure rays (angelic intellects); then casts images on a screen (imaginal forms); finally illuminating a dark room faintly (material world). All are Presences of One Being – not five Allahs (Ḥāshā\!), but five modes of Divine self-disclosure, from utmost transcendence to intimate immanence. These correspond as well to the famous Qāḍīya (the Covenant of Alast and the archetypal realities) down to the human realm of bodies.

The journey of existence is a descent (tanazzul) from the One through these Presences into multiplicity, and the journey of the seeker is an ascent (miʿrāj) back through these layers to Unity. We came *from* Hāhūt (breathed into Adam’s clay was a spirit from Allah), and we return through Lāhūt, Jabarūt, Malakūt, to transcend Nāsūt once more\[6\]. Every prayer, every moment of dhikr, is a step inward – an inward *ascension* peeling away one veil of opacity. When we invoke *“Allāh, Allāh,”* our spirits leap from Nāsūt toward Malakūt (lifting our hearts beyond the sensory); when we meditate on the Quran’s meanings, our minds touch Jabarūt (the realm of pure understanding); when we lose ourselves in awe at His Attributes, our souls graze the hems of Lāhūt (Divine Presence); and in moments of annihilative ecstasy, we taste Hāhūt (the Black Light that obliterates us in Itself).

Know, dear friend, that this cosmology is not merely theory – it is a practical map for the *inner traveler*. You asked of rituals outside orthodox practice but paralleling Sufi cosmology: consider this isomorphism – five layers of the self that mirror the Five Presences. The macrocosm is reflected in the microcosm of the soul. To that we now turn.

## 

## The Seven Nafs and the Mirror of the Soul

السلام عليك يا باحث عن الحقيقة وبركاته ورحمة الله وبركاته:

As the cosmos has its layers, so does the human soul. The sages of tasawwuf delineate the seven nafs, stages or states of the self, from the darkest ego to the purest spirit. Each of us carries the whole cosmos in miniature; the struggle within is the struggle to ascend from the Nāsūt of our ego to the Hāhūt of our secret heart. I write to you now of these seven stages of the soul’s refinement, for they form a ladder any seeker can climb, and they correspond in subtle ways to the states known in other paths (even, as we shall see, to the meditative absorptions of the Buddhists – the jhānas – though we interpret them in the light of tawḥīd).

Here are the Seven Nafs (selves) identified by our tradition, in order from lowest to highest. Consider them like seven mirrors, each more polished and reflecting the Divine light more clearly than the last:

### An–Nafs al–Ammārah (The Commanding Self)

This is the ego in its base, impulsive state, “the self that incites to evil.” It mirrors only darkness. Here the soul is tyrannical, dominated by passions and selfish desires. It urges one to indulge, to anger, to pride. In Quranic terms, *“Surely the nafs commands to evil”* (12:53). It is the Nāsūt within us – the most material, animal layer, essentially blind to Allah.

### An–Nafs al–Lawwāmah (The Blaming or Reproachful Self)

The stage of conscience awakened. The soul now knows right from wrong enough to reproach itself when it lapses. This is the birth of morality and self-awareness. The Quran swears by this self (75:2), indicating its importance. In this state, one is *divided*: often regretful after sinning, oscillating between piety and lapse. The Light has dawned faintly, but the clouds of ego have not cleared.

### An–Nafs al–Mulhimah (The Inspired Self)

At this stage, through struggling and sincere practice, the soul becomes receptive to ilhām (inspiration) from Allah. It is as if a window opens; intuition and subtle guidance begin to reach one. Good deeds and repentance become beloved. The person at this level experiences moments of true inspiration – insights, vivid meaningful dreams, guidance that seems to arrive unbidden. This corresponds to the stirrings of the Malakūt within – the imaginal and angelic influence guiding the soul.

### An–Nafs al–Muṭmaʾinnah (The Peaceful or Tranquil Self)

This soul has found sakinah (inner peace) in remembrance of Allah. *“O serene soul, return to your Lord, well-pleased and well-pleasing”* (89:27-28) is said of this state. Here the heart is mostly free of doubt and disturbance; it trusts in Allah’s decree. This is a station of deep contentment and equanimity. One’s character is balanced; desires have been tamed and harmonized. This inner tranquility is a *taste of Jabarūt within* – the stability and clarity of the angelic mind reflected in a human breast.

### An–Nafs ar–Rāḍiyah (The Contented Self)

‘Rāḍiyah’ means well-pleased. At this level, the soul is not only peaceful but actively content *with Allah’s will*. One is *pleased with whatever Allah decrees*, having surrendered personal desire entirely. Gratitude and acceptance flow continuously. This station is sometimes merged with the next; together they reflect the state of complete acceptance.

#### 

### An–Nafs al–Marḍiyyah (The Pleasing Self)

‘Marḍiyyah’ means pleasing to Allah. This is the station where not only is the seeker content with Allah, Allah is content with the seeker. It indicates a soul that Allah has approved of and loves. The person becomes a true servant and friend of Allah (walī). The virtues are fully established, the vices effaced. In this and the previous stage, the Divine Attributes of Beauty shine through the person’s character – mercy, patience, kindness, justice radiate from them. It is as though the Light of Lāhūt (the Divine Attributes) now colors the soul’s mirror completely.

### An–Nafs aṣ–Ṣāfiyyah or al-Kāmilah (The Pure Self or Perfected Self)

This final stage is the purified, complete soul. The mirror is polished to transparency; it reflects only the truth. This is the soul of the Insān al-Kāmil, the Complete Human Being, who is the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ in the highest example, and after him the inheriting saints to their respective degrees. In this station, the self has annihilated (fanāʼ) in Allah and subsists (baqāʼ) by Allah – it wants nothing but what Allah wants. The ego-self has died before physical death. This is the peak of tawḥīd in the soul: *la ilaha illa’Llah* is not just professed, but realized – “There is no reality but Allah.” The black light of Hāhūt, the divine Ipseity, has *consumed the individual self utterly*, leaving only the divine reality shining through.

### Remarks

Observe how the journey through the seven nafs is a journey inward and upward – an ascent from the outermost Nāsūt-like state of Ammārah (all clay and passion) to the innermost Hāhūt-like state of Ṣāfiyyah (pure divine reflection). This ladder corresponds in part to *virtue ethics* (weaning the soul from blameworthy traits and inculcating praiseworthy ones), but it also parallels experiences of expanded awareness. This book is a map of psychospiritual conditions one may encounter on the path of dhikr and murāqabah.

Let me draw an analogy (with due caution and reverence): Imagine a devoted dervish sits for dhikr, invoking Allāh’s name in solitude. At first, his mind is scattered. But as he focuses, by Allah’s grace, he may enter a state of strong joyful concentration – a spiritual rapture characterized by intense bliss and focused thought. As he continues, thoughts quiet and a more tranquil happiness pervade: joy without discursive thought. Deeper still, joy softens to contentment and vast stillness: deep contentment and beginning of equanimity. Further, even that pleasant feeling refines into neutral peaceful clarity, a clarity in which the only remaining sensation is a pure one-pointed light of awareness: utter peacefulness and equanimity). These first four states correspond to the soul moving into Nafs al-Muṭmaʾinnah and tasting the peace that comes when the ego’s chatter stills.

But there are higher subtleties: beyond the peace of form, the seeker might be drawn into formless contemplation. He may sense the boundlessness of space as he remembers Allah’s infinite being. Beyond that, he realizes the boundlessness of consciousness itself witnessing creation. Deeper, he experiences “no-thingness” – the recognition that aside from Allāh, nothing truly exists. Further yet, he approaches a state where it is as if there is neither perception nor non-perception – an almost unfathomable stillness at the threshold of extinction.

And finally, by Allah’s will, the seeker may plunge into a state of complete fana – cessation of individual awareness, the *annihilation of annihilation* that the Sufis speak of. This is fanā fi’Llāh, passing away in the One, a taste of the reality where only Allah is.

*The human being’s inner capacity is vast and resonates across traditions*. Among the Ahl al-Kitāb, learnned men write of the same inner stations that a Muslim seeker finds: states of *wujud* (ecstatic existence in Allah’s presence) and *sukūn* (serenity) and *fanā*. We map our journey by a language of love and nearness to Allah.

Najm al-Dīn al-Rāzī wrote of a luminous night in which the final theophany of Allah’s Majesty seizes the seeker. The ‘black light’ is that of the attribute of Majesty which sets the mystic’s being on fire; it attacks, invades, annihilates even the notion of annihilation until nothing remains but Him. This is Fanā al-Fanā, the annihilation of any separate selfhood so that only Allah’s light shines – what remains is *Baqā*ʾ, eternal subsistence in Allah.

So do not be surprised, dear friend, when you find parallels between our ladder of selves and the contemplative maps of others. Truth is one, and hearts – created by the One – often awaken to similar realities. The key is always tawḥīd: to know *La ilaha illa’Llah*, beyond mere words, in the core of one’s being. Muraqabah can benefit the seeker of Allah, anchored  in dhikrullah (remembrance of Allah) and shahada (the acknowledgment of Allah’s Oneness).

The seven stages of the soul are our framework for inner work. They correspond to increasing light and surrender. They also align with that universal gradient of spiritual experience: from chaos to conscience, to inspiration, to serenity, to contentment, to annihilation in Light. Each stage of *nafs* tamed opens the door to a subtler state of consciousness.

As we subdue the Commanding Self and cultivate the Inspired Self, we naturally experience the kind of joy and rapture that comes with hearts opening to the divine. As we settle into the Peaceful Self and higher, we experience equanimity, subtle vision, and moments of dissolving into something far greater – moments that are our tradition’s *dhawq* (tasting) of fanā. All is by the grace of Allah. We plan and strive, but it is *He* who lifts the veil.

These experiences are gifts and trials. One may soar in a state of annihilation one night and return to struggles with one’s ego the next day. The path is long and winding, and istiqāmah (steadfastness) is the miracle we seek, not flashes of ecstasy alone. Imam al-Junayd said: *“The ultimate goal of the Sufi is to be with Allah without any attachment.”* So we pass through the joys and the lights, and even the dazzling dark, and we do not cling to any station. We keep polishing the mirror of the heart, seeking the Pleasure of our Lord above all.

## Nawāfil of the Wayfarer

Dhikr, Meditation, and Devotional Craft  
السلام عليك يا باحث عن الحقيقة وبركاته ورحمة الله وبركاته:

The line between ritual and reality is thin in the realm of the imaginal. These humble observances are not obligations (farāʾiḍ) but supererogatory acts of love (nawāfil) by which, as the hadith qudsī says, *“My servant continues to draw near to Me with extra works until I love him.”* These are given by a Nameless Sheikh in the spirit of dhikr and tawḥīd, though like him they may wear unusual garb.

### The Circle of Five Lights

A solitary vigil in the dead of night. The seeker places five lamps or candles in a circle around them, representing the Five Divine Presences. Sitting at the center, they recite Quranic verses or divine Names associated with each realm in turn, moving counter-clockwise (for example: at the first lamp, recite a verse of earth and humility for Nasut; at the second, verses of the unseen for Malakut; at the third, praises of angels for Jabarut; at the fourth, verses of Allah’s beautiful Names for Lahut; at the fifth, the shahāda or verses of Divine Oneness for Hahut). As each lamp is lit and its verses read, the seeker envisions ascending one level closer to the Throne. Finally, at the center of the circle, they close their eyes and perform muraqabah as if standing before the One. This ritual, though not from any fiqh manual, elegantly harmonizes with cosmology: it externalizes the ascent through the Presences in candlelight, invoking the realities of each world in prayer. The five lamps are outward forms of the five inward lights. If done with adab (proper courtesy) and within Shari‘a bounds (no forbidden practices), such a ritual could kindle a profound understanding of Allah’s nearness throughout the layers of being. It is “outside Islam” only in the sense of not being a standard mosque practice, yet its meaning is deeply Islamic – a miʿrāj of the soul in miniature, an echo of the Prophet’s Night Journey through the heavens, made personal.

### The Dance of the Seven Selves

In a private space, the seeker lays out seven stones or markers in a line or spiral, each corresponding to one of the seven nafs stages. They begin at the stone for Ammārah (the lower self) and perform a humble, grounding action – perhaps prostrating or touching the earth, acknowledging their flaws and asking Allah’s aid against the commanding ego. Then they move to the next marker (Lawwāmah), maybe circling it while whispering astaghfiru’Llāh (I seek Allah’s forgiveness) to symbolize self-reproach and repentance. At Mulhimah’s marker, they might stand upright, palms open, breathing in silently – signifying readiness to receive inspiration (almost like adopting a yogic posture of openness, though they invoke Allah’s Name quietly with each breath, aligning it firmly with dhikr). At Muṭmaʾinnah, they sit calmly in silent meditation or perform a slow dhikr with the heart – say, repeating *Allāh… Allāh…* in a steady rhythm, signifying inner peace. For Rāḍiyah, they might bow in gratitude, thanking Allah for everything – an embodiment of contentment with His decree. For Marḍiyyah, perhaps they place their hand on their heart and envision it shining – the idea that Allah is pleased with this purified heart, so it radiates with His light. Finally, at Ṣāfiyyah, the seeker stands under the open sky (if possible) or simply raises their arms upward, eyes closed, in total surrender – symbolizing the annihilation of self, letting the self “dissolve” into the night sky or the vastness above. They might recite *“Inna lillahi wa inna ilayhi rāji*ʿ*ūn”* (“Truly we belong to Allah, and to Him we return”) or simply fall into a final sujūd (prostration) without words, representing fanā. This is a ritual movement practice, reminiscent of how some dervish orders use controlled movement or dance (like the Mevlevi whirling). Though not a known Sufi tariqa exercise per se, it is plausible and powerful: it externalizes the inner journey, giving the body a role in training the soul. Each station’s physical gesture becomes a *mnemonic device* to reinforce that stage’s lesson. By the end, the mystic has enacted an allegory of transformation, a prayer made body. There is nothing explicitly un-Islamic in bowing, breathing, and prostrating with holy intent – it is the *structure and narrative* that are creative. As long as such practice remains a personal devotion and does not transgress (e.g., no shirk, no indecent moves), it can be a legitimate “exercise” on the Path.

### 

### Dhikr of the Unified Field

A numerical-litany muraqabah using the code from Letter I. Here the seeker uses our *36-character alphanumeric table* as a remembrance. They might draw the 6×6 grid on paper or engrave it on a wooden tablet. Around the edges they write the Quranic phrase *“Huwa Al-Awwalu wal-Ākhiru wal-Ẓāhiru wal-Bāṭin”* (“He is the First and the Last, the Outward and the Inward”) – emphasizing Allah as encompassing all beginnings and ends (Alpha–Omega, Alif–Yā). The ritual proceeds in three parts: writing, reciting, and meditating. First, the seeker writes an intention or prayer *in code* using the table – for example, writing the word نُور (Nur, “Light”) as “NUR” in Latin letters, since N=23, U=30, R=27 in base-36, which correspond to ن, و, ر. Or they might encode a Name of Allah, like الحكيم (Al-Hakim, The Wise) as a string of numbers and letters. The act of encoding is itself a contemplative prayer: one focuses on the meaning while translating it into the hidden language. Next, they recite the sequence of symbols as a litany. This can be done in two ways – either literally pronouncing the numbers and letters (e.g. “Two-Three, En, Yu, Ar…” – which has a certain melodic oddness), or by *decoding* on the fly and uttering the original words intended (e.g. reciting “Nur” or “Al-Hakim” in Arabic after having encoded it). The interesting twist is to sometimes do one, sometimes the other, so that the mind toggles between apparent gibberish and actual meaning, training it to see *through* the veil of forms. Finally, the seeker meditates upon the written tablet, allowing the eyes to soften and seeing if the coded text yields further insight – perhaps the shapes of the characters intermingling suggest new relationships, or the numbers remind them of sacred numerology (36 itself recalling 6x6 \= 36, which in turn is 9 (3+6) the number of completion, etc.). In this heightened state, oen may perceive he *universe as letters* by means of wird (litany repetition), wafq (magic square), hurufiyyat (letter mysticism), and of course dhikr. The theology remains sound: one encodes only *pious phrases or Names of Allah*. The aim is increased concentration and an almost childlike sense of play in remembrance – seeing the *unity* behind disparate symbols. One comes away marveling at how Allah’s Names permeate even the realms of number and the  script of Rūm. The key outcome of such a ritual is a stronger conviction that *“Allahu Ahad”* – Allah is One – for the seeker has tasted how one meaning can hide under many forms, and how the One speaks through all languages of creation.

### The Black Light Vigil (Mushāhadat an-Nūr al-Aswad)

This ritual is directly inspired by Sufi metaphysics. The seeker prepares by reading or recalling how the great Masters spoke of Nūr-e-Siyāh, the Black Light of the Divine Hiddenness. After the late-night \`ʿIshā prayer, they sit in complete darkness – a room with no light at all. This darkness is taken as *analogical* to the divine Mystery. The seeker begins with a duʿā (supplication): *“O Allah, You are al-Bāṭin (The Hidden); reveal to me, as much as I can bear, a glimpse of the light of Your Hiddenness.”* Then they perform a slow dhikr, often the shahāda or the Name “Allāh,” synchronized with their breath and heartbeats, while plunging attention into the blackness before their eyes. The goal is not imaginative visions but a shift of perception: to realize that this “darkness” is not merely an absence of light but a presence – akin to how Najm al-Dīn Kubrā’s disciples described the Black Light as a *prelude* to the highest epiphany. If the Merciful wills, the seeker may feel a strange illumination in that darkness – an awareness that the ظلمة (zulmah, darkness) behind closed eyes actually shimmers with an unseen glow. Some have described it as seeing a faint indigo or feeling a potent presence filling the void. It may induce both awe and fear – awe because it feels like touching the edge of the Infinite, fear because the ego senses its own annihilation in that abyss. The seeker continues the dhikr until their heart is trembling but serene, “annihilated” into the night. Then they humbly end with *astaghfirullah* (seeking forgiveness) and two rakʿats of prayer, grounding the experience back in Sharia. The Black Light *cannot be seen, because it is the cause of seeing*. By courting the experience of *fanāʼ* (annihilation) in a controlled, reverent way, the seeker aligns it with *tawḥīd*: understanding that entering the “cloud of unknowing” is not union with some impersonal void, but a communion with the Divine Majesty (Jalāl) in a form beyond forms. This ritual should only be attempted by those well-grounded in faith and practice, for it can be jarring. But for the ripe soul, it can confirm in *‘ayn al-yaqīn* (the eye of certainty) what books can only tell: that beyond the final veil of perception lies an overpowering Reality in whose presence selfhood is burned to ash – yet that very annihilation is the entry to subsistence in Allah. In simpler terms, the seeker might come out of this saying, “I learned through direct experience that *Lā ilāha illa Allāh* – there truly is no light or being but Allah; all else vanishes.” They would taste a bit of what the Qur’an hints: *“Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth”* – and even the “darkness” is a form of His light.

My dear friend, these are examples of the *devotional creativity* a sincere lover of Allah might employ. None is meant to replace the Obligations that every Muslim owes (the five daily prayers, fasting Ramadan, etc.). Rather, they are personal additions, *analogical exercises* to deepen one’s understanding. Just as a muscle strengthens with varied workouts, the spirit may strengthen with novel yet pious devotions. Our predecessors often performed Khalwa (spiritual retreats) that had many unusual features – isolated in dark caves, focusing on certain names, performing thousands of repetitions of a formula.

Each of these imagined rites is compatible with tawḥīd: the ultimate aim remains to witness that all phenomena – all lights and all shadows – point back to the One. By mapping our practices to cosmic and soul realities, we live the Quranic principle that *“We shall show them Our signs on the horizons and in themselves until it becomes clear that He is the Real”*. The “five lamps” show His signs in the horizons (cosmic levels), the “seven stones dance” shows His signs in ourselves (psychological levels). The encoded dhikr shows that even random-seeming symbols yield to meaningful unity under the light of the Real. The black light vigil surrenders perception itself to the Source of all light. In times and places where the esoteric is mistrusted, such a *samizdat* of the spirit may keep the flame alive among hidden believers.

Throughout all such practices, humility and balance are paramount. If one finds any of them leading to pride (“I have secret knowledge or powers”), one must stop and return to the simplicity of istighfar and salat. The devotions of a hedge-mystic must remain in the shadows, not seeking worldly attention or acclaim – *hidden by mercy*, as we say, so that Allah protects both the practitioner and the sanctity of the work.

## Closing Counsel

Anonymous Devotion and Loving Submission

السلام عليك يا باحث عن الحقيقة وبركاته ورحمة الله وبركاته:

As I conclude this compendium of letters, my heart is full of prayers for you. We have wandered through lofty ideas and subtle practices, in an attempt to remember our Origin and our Return. Like the letters of our abjad, we too are symbols yearning to lose ourselves in the Word of Allah.

In this final letter, I offer you counsel in the spirit of devotional anonymity: remember that *ego* will undo every good work if given a chance. So wear the cloak of anonymous humility in all your mystical pursuits. Let your deeds be as an unseen waft of perfume in a crowded room – noticeable but source unknown. The best of servants are those who serve and vanish, letting Allah’s own presence be felt. The goal of these letters is to enrich your solitary communion with the One. Be in the world but not of it; outwardly ordinary, inwardly absorbed in the Extraordinary.

If you practice the numerological ciphers, do so playfully, not legalistically – as a child hiding love notes. If you undertake the candle vigil or the stone dance, treat them as *extensions of your salat*, not replacements. **Should any spiritual romance we have spoken of conflict with the Shari‘a in letter or spirit, abandon it immediately and choose the Shari‘a.** True tawḥīd (affirming Divine Unity) sometimes means going beyond *exoteric forms* to grasp the inner meaning – but it never means disobedience to Allah .

Above all, cultivate devotion (maḥabba) and awe (khushūʿ). Every speculative leap we embraced in these letters – whether merging Arabic letters, paralleling jhānas with states of dhikr, or crafting new rites – must be grounded in *love of Allah and humble reverence*. We do these things not to show cleverness (which would be spiritual poison), but out of a yearning to know and worship our Lord in every way He allows. As the Qur’an beautifully states, *“Those who believe are overflowing in their love for Allah”*. Let that be your state. If a practice increases your love and awe, and does not make you heedless of your duties, it is likely a blessing. If it decreases your love or makes you even for a moment feel self-satisfied, cast it away, for it hides a poison.

We are the faithful, hidden by mercy. We hide so that ego and dunya (worldliness) cannot find us easily. We are concealed by Allah’s mercy like Moses, set afloat in a basket until the appointed time. We are not better than any fellow Muslim – only perhaps more aware that for people like us, a certain secrecy is safety. We do not seek to scandalize the common faithful, nor to argue with the theologians. We simply *are*, on the margins, loving Allah in ways both old and new, drawing from the wells of tradition and inspiration.

Before I end, I invoke the image of the Nameless Sheikh – the wise one who passes through villages in humble guise, dispensing help and insight without anyone knowing their name. Emulate that. Let your works shine but your person disappear. Be the pen, not the calligrapher; the flute, not the musician – *so that the real Author of all beauty, Allah, may be praised* while you remain His instrument. The letters I penned to you, I release them in that spirit: I claim no ownership; they are yours now, and if they benefit any heart, the thanks is to Allah alone. If there are errors, they are mine and I seek forgiveness.

Devotion in the guise of a letter, anatomies of the soul hiddenn in  a love poem, knowledge conveyed as a secret between friends – this has always been how the deepest truths survive turbulent times. In Soviet days, samizdat booklets kept faith alive under watchful eyes. In our day, perhaps these missives will encourage a soul or two to trust their intimate experiences of the Divine, even if these go beyond what is normally discussed in the open. We have shown that nothing in those experiences *has to* contradict the essence of Islam; in fact, when rightly framed, they can enhance one’s appreciation of tawḥīd and the richness of the Prophetic way.

I urge you finally: ***never abandon the Quran***. It is the anchor of reality. However far your inner journeys or creative rituals take you, keep returning to that recitation, that wellspring. All the cosmology we described is contained in *al-Fātiḥah* if you taste it. All the stations of the self are hinted when you read about Prophet Ibrahim, peace be upon him, whose quest in the stars and moon and sun and led him to realize *“Innī wajjahtu wajhiya lilladhī faṭara as-samāwāti wal-arḍ”* – “I have turned my face wholly to Him who originated the heavens and earth.” The Black Light is there in *Āyat an-Nūr* (24:35) if you read it with the eye of the heart. So use the Quran as your compass; use the Sharīʿa as your ship’s hull; use these speculative insights only as the breeze in your sails, to carry you more swiftly to the shore of Allah’s pleasure.

My dear one, I will cease now. I feel the barakah of night passing, the false dawn perhaps glimmering. How beautiful that we began in the Name of Allah, and we end in His praise. Al-ḥamdu lillāh. Thank you for walking this hidden garden of meanings with me. Keep these letters safe or destroy them as you see fit; their true content is already written in your soul if you have understood. We entrust our affairs to Allah. May He join us in the secret communion of hearts, though outwardly we remain unknown to each other, *faces hidden behind the veil of divine mercy.*

Remain vigilant, remain humble, remain in love with the Loving One. In the end, all mysticism is just good manners in front of Allah – the manners of presence, gratitude, and surrender. Let that be our hallmark.

أعزك الله وبارك في عمرك وأعمالك وحفظك في عافيتك ووطنك وشعبك وأسرتك الشريفة

# Deeper Still

From the Rotting Sun to the Black Light of the Essence

### The Act of Esoteric Interpretation (Ta'wīl)

In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. This treatise is an act of *ta'wīl*, the sacred science of unveiling the inner *bāṭin* that lies veiled within the outer form *ẓāhir*. The cosmos is a living theophany, and this work is a guide for the sincere and independent *sālik*.

### Nafṭ as the Unmanifest Divine

*Nafṭ* is a symbol of the *adh-Dhāt al-Ilāhiyyah*. It is the physical trace of the "Hidden Treasure," the pre-eternal reality from which all existence flows. It recalls the *an-Nūr al-Aswad*, the dazzling darkness of Allah before creation.

Ours is the inward journey to the *qalb*, the seat of Divine mystery, revealed by the cosmic drama of *tajallī*, a process of emanation that flows from the deepest interior of Reality to the manifest surface of the world. *Sālik*, you must excavate the depths of your own being to uncover the source of all existence.

## Al-Kashf al-Ilāhī

To walk the Path, you must first possess a map of reality – and you do. You have had it all along, for inscribed upon the chaotic, horizontal plane of conflict and material causality is a *cipher* of the ordered, vertical axis of Divine cosmology, which charts the journey from the Source and the return to the Source.

### The Theophany of the Hidden Treasure

The foundation of all Sufi cosmology, and the key that unlocks the purpose of creation, is found in a sacred tradition (*Hadith Qudsi*), wherein Allah speaks through the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him:

كنت كنزا مخفياً فأحببت أن أعرف فخلقت الخلق لكي أعرف  
Kuntu kanzan makhfiyyan fa aḥbabtu an u'rafa fa khalaqtu al-khalqa li-kay u'raf.  
"I was a Hidden Treasure and I yearned to be known, so I created the cosmos that I might be known."

This single statement transforms the universe from a meaningless void into a theater of revelation. The motive force behind existence is not a blind telluric process or a cosmic accident, but *'Ishq* and the yearning for Self-knowledge through the mirror of creation The cosmos is an act of unveiling, a vast and intricate sign pointing back to its Creator.

### The Unity of Being (Waḥdat al-wujūd)

The grammar of this revealed cosmos is the doctrine of *Waḥdat al-wujūd*, most famously articulated by the great master Muhyiddin ibn 'Arabi. This doctrine states that there is only one true *wujūd*, and that Being is Allah. All of creation—every star, every grain of sand, every human soul—has no independent existence of its own. Rather, all created things are but shadows, reflections, or *maẓhar* for the singular reality of *al-Ḥaqq*. The external world of sensible objects is a fleeting shadow of the one, eternal Reality.

The horror of the *kafir*’s cosmos stems from its terrifying multiplicity and the indifference of its parts to one another. The *wajd* of the path is born from the progressive realization of the universe's fundamental and all-encompassing Oneness. The goal is *ittiḥād* with the all-inclusive Beloved.

### The Five Divine Presences (Al-Ḥaḍarāt al-Ilāhiyyah al-Khams)

The descent of the singular Reality of *wujūd* into the multiplicity of the created world occurs through successive stages of Self-disclosure. These are known as the Five Divine Presences, and they provide the *sālik* with a coherent map of all levels of existence, from the most subtle to the most dense. This is the true "subsurface geography" of being

1. *ʿĀlam al-Hāhūt* (The Realm of He-ness): This is the realm of the unknowable Divine Essence, the absolute Unseen (*al-Ghayb al-Mutlaq*) It is the level of "Alonehood" (*Ahdiyat*), prior to all attributes, names, or relations. It is the Hidden Treasure in its absolute hiddenness, the pure blackness of the Black Light.  
2. *ʿĀlam al-Lāhūt* (The Realm of Divinity): This is the first level of manifestation, the realm of Absolute Unity (*Wahdiyat*) Here, the Essence manifests its potential as a unified whole, containing all of the Divine Names and Attributes in an undifferentiated state. This is the reality of the "Light of Muhammad" (*Nūr Muḥammadī*), the cosmic archetype of the Perfect Human Being and the seed of all creation.  
3. *ʿĀlam al-Jabarūt* (The Realm of Power): This is the world of pure spiritual Intellects, the formless archetypes, and the highest ranks of angels Here, the unified attributes of *Lāhūt* begin to differentiate into the distinct ideas or eternal realities (*a'yān al-thābitah*) of all things that will ever exist.  
4. *ʿĀlam al-Malakūt* (The Realm of Archetypal Images): This is the subtle world of the Soul (*Rūḥ*) and the imagination (*khayāl*). Here, the formless archetypes of *Jabarūt* take on subtle, luminous, but still immaterial forms. It is the realm inhabited by the lower angels and the jinn, and it is the plane upon which dreams and visions occur  
5. *ʿĀlam al-Nāsūt* (The Realm of the Sensible): This is the physical, material world perceived by the five senses. It is the realm of humanity, the world of density and multiplicity, and the final stage of the Divine descent into manifestation It is the outermost shell of reality, yet it contains within it the impress of all the higher realms.

### The Earth as a Living Mirror (Al-Arḍ ka-l-Mir'āh)

The whole of the Earth—and indeed the entire cosmos—is a living artifact, a polished mirror that reflects the *asmāʾ Allāh*. The hardness of a rock reflects the Divine Name *al-Qawī*, the life-giving property of water reflects *al-Muḥyī*, and the beauty of a flower reflects *al-Jamīl*.

The profane actions of humanity are the acts of those who are veiled from this sacred reality They see only the outer shell, the resource to be exploited, and are blind to the inner meaning. The task of the *sālik* is to pierce this veil and perceive the *bāṭin* of the Earth; to see it not as a commodity, but as a vast *sajjāda* upon which the *āyāt* of Allah are displayed for those with hearts that see.

## 

## Ṭarīq as-Sālik

The Way of the Seeker

The journey from the outer shell (*ẓāhir*) to the inner core (*bāṭin*) requires both a map and a method. This section provides the practical sciences of the Path, transmuting the occulted "mechanics" of the source text into the established spiritual disciplines of *taṣawwuf*.

### The Science of the Letters ('Ilm al-Ḥurūf): A Key to the Divine Cipher

The science of Abjad numerology, known as *'Ilm al-Ḥurūf* (the Science of the Letters), is not a mere tool for divination but a profound contemplative practice for uncovering the hidden order of the cosmos The letters of the Arabic alphabet are understood to be the primordial building blocks of creation, the very atoms of the Divine creative command *Kun\!*. Each letter possesses a numerical value, an elemental correspondence, and a spiritual secret that connects it to a Divine Name By calculating the numerical value of a word or a verse from the Qur'an, the *Sālik* can unveil hidden relationships and layers of meaning, perceiving the intricate mathematical harmony that underpins all of reality.

### The Unveiling of Signs (Kashf al-Ishārāt): The Gaze of the Heart

While we may allude to external methods of divination, the Path emphasizes the cultivation of the heart's own perceptive faculty. The world is already full of signs; the task is to develop the vision to read them.

* *Firāsah* (Spiritual Insight): This is the Allah-given insight of the believer, the ability to perceive the inner state (*bāṭin*) of a person, object, or situation from its outer form (*ẓāhir*). It is based on the sacred tradition of the Prophet, peace be upon him, who said, "Beware the *firāsah* of the believer, for he sees with the light of Allah." This is not a magical power but the natural result of a heart that has been purified and polished through remembrance until it reflects the Divine Light.  
* *Istikhārah* (The Prayer for Guidance): Rather than attempting to force the future to reveal its secrets, the *sālik* turns to the Knower of all secrets. *Ṣalāt al-Istikhārah* is a specific prayer of two *rak'āt* followed by a supplication in which the *sālik* asks Allah to guide them towards the best course of action in a particular matter. The answer comes not through a mechanical oracle, but through a sign that Allah places in one's heart, a feeling of ease or constriction, or through a dream or an event in the world that clarifies the path forward. This transforms divination from an act of fortune-telling into an intimate conversation with the Divine.

### The Pillars of Practice: Remembrance and Contemplation (Dhikr wa Murāqabah)

The core of the practical path consists of two complementary disciplines: *Dhikr*, the remembrance that polishes the mirror of the heart, and *Murāqabah*, the watchful contemplation that allows the heart to perceive what is reflected in it.

#### Preparation for Practice

Before beginning, the *sālik* should ensure both outer and inner purity.

1. *Wuḍūʾ*: Perform the ritual ablution to achieve a state of physical and spiritual cleanliness  
2. *Khalwah*: Find a quiet, clean, and preferably dark space where one will not be disturbed  
3. *Niyyah*: Center the heart and make a clear intention to perform these practices solely for the sake of drawing near to Allah

#### 

#### Dhikr (Remembrance)

*Dhikr* is the invocation of Allah's name, the central practice for purifying the heart of heedlessness (*ghaflah*).

* *Dhikr al-Lisānī*: The *sālik* repeats sacred formulas aloud, such as *Lā ilāha illā Allāh*, *Alḥamdulillāh*, or one of the Names of Allah.  
* *Dhikr al-Qalbī*: This is the more advanced practice of internalizing the remembrance until it becomes perpetual. A common method is known as *Hosh dar Dam* (Conscious Breathing) With each inhalation, the *sālik* silently invokes the name *Allāh* or the syllable *Hū*, imagining divine light and mercy entering the heart. With each exhalation, the *sālik* again invokes *Hū*, imagining all darkness, negativity, and attachment to the world being expelled. The goal is for this remembrance to become so ingrained that it continues with the heartbeat and breath even during sleep and daily activities.

#### Murāqabah

*Murāqabah* means "to watch over" or "to be vigilant." It is the practice of turning the full attention of the heart away from the created world and towards the Creator.

1. Assume a Respectful Posture: Sit in a position of humility, such as kneeling or cross-legged. Close the eyes and quiet the senses.  
2. Establish Connection (*Rābiṭah*): For many on the path, the first step is to visualize the spiritual presence of one's *shaykh*, imagining a connection of light flowing from their heart to one's own. This is a means of receiving *fayḍ* and guidance  
3. Focus the Heart: The *sālik* then directs the heart's attention towards a single point of contemplation. This could be:  
   * The Divine Name: Visualizing the name *Allāh* (الله) engraved in light upon one's own heart  
   * A Divine Attribute: Contemplating one of the Names of Allah, such as *al-Baṣīr*, and striving to feel that one is perpetually under the Divine Gaze.  
   * The Unity of Being: Contemplating the interconnectedness of all things, seeing every form as a manifestation of the one Divine Reality, until the distinction between self and other begins to dissolve.

The seeker remains in this state of watchful awareness for a set period, beginning with minutes and gradually increasing the duration as their capacity for concentration grows

### 

### The Journey Through the Self: The Seven Stations of the Nafs

The spiritual path is a process of transformation, known as the *tazkiyat an-nafs*. This journey is traditionally mapped as a progression through seven stations or levels of the *nafs* (the ego, psyche, or lower self). Each station represents a fundamental shift in consciousness, moving from utter heedlessness to perfected submission

Table: The Seven Stations of the Self (Maqāmāt an-Nafs)

| Station | Arabic Name & Transliteration | English Name | Core Attributes & Qur'anic Reference |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1 | النفس الأمّارة (*an-Nafs al-Ammārah*) | The Commanding Self | Commands evil; dominated by lust, anger, greed, arrogance. (Qur'an) |
| 2 | النفس اللوامة (*an-Nafs al-Lawwāmah*) | The Blaming Self | The awakening conscience; feels guilt and regret for wrongdoing. (Qur'an) |
| 3 | النفس الملهمة (*an-Nafs al-Mulhamah*) | The Inspired Self | Begins to receive divine inspiration; finds pleasure in prayer, meditation, knowledge. (Qur'an) |
| 4 | النفس المطمئنة (*an-Nafs al-Muṭma'innah*) | The Serene Self | Tranquility and peace; freed from major spiritual anxieties and worldly attachments. (Qur'an) |
| 5 | النفس الراضية (*an-Nafs ar-Rāḍiyah*) | The Pleased Self | Contentment with whatever comes from Allah, whether hardship or ease. (Qur'an) |
| 6 | النفس المرضية (*an-Nafs al-Marḍiyyah*) | The Pleasing Self | The self has become pleasing to Allah; embodies divine qualities like mercy and compassion. (Qur'an) |
| 7 | النفس الكاملة (*an-Nafs al-Kāmilah*) | The Perfected Self | The purified and complete self, living in a state of perfect submission and guidance. |

This map provides the *sālik* with the means to diagnose their spiritual state and understand the challenges and virtues associated with each stage of the inner journey

## Sukkān wa Lisān al-Ghayb

The Inhabitants and Language of the Unseen

To understand the true nature of the Unseen and its inhabitants as described in the Islamic revelation, one must learn the sublime language of Divine Love used to describe the Path.

### The Language of the Beloved: A Lexicon of Allegory

The Sufis, finding that direct language fails to capture the ineffable realities of the spiritual path, developed a rich symbolic lexicon rooted in the experience of ecstatic love To change the "flavor" of the text is to learn this language, where every term is a key to a specific spiritual state (*ḥāl*) or station (*maqām*).

* **'Āshiq and Ma'shūq**: This is the central metaphor of the Path. The *sālik* is the *'āshiq*, and Allah is the *ma'shūq*. The entire spiritual journey is framed as a romance, driven by an intense *shawq* for union with the Divine Beloved, who is simultaneously transcendent and closer to the *sālik* than their own jugular vein  
* **Khamr and Kharābāt**:  
  * ***Khamr***: This is the symbol for the direct, experiential knowledge of Allah (*ma'rifah*) and the overwhelming ecstasy of Divine Love. This "wine" intoxicates the *sālik*, dissolving the rational, calculating ego and revealing the secrets of unity. It is a "dangerous substance" because once tasted, it makes the *sālik* willing to sacrifice everything—wealth, reputation, even life itself—for another sip  
  * ***Sāqī***: This is the *shaykh*: the Divine Beloved Itself, who pours the wine of love into a *sālik*’s heart, which is the *jām*.  
  * ***Kharābāt***: This symbolizes the "Tavern of Ruin." It is the spiritual station where the *sālik*’s conventional piety and social identity are annihilated. It represents a space beyond the formalisms of exoteric religion, where the lover meets the Beloved in a state of pure, unmediated ecstatic intimacy, free from the judgments of the world  
* **The Moth and the Flame**: Such is the nature of *fanā'*. The *sālik* is the moth, helplessly and ecstatically drawn to the irresistible beauty of the Divine Reality, which is the Flame. The path has three stages of knowing, analogous to the moth's journey: hearing about the flame, seeing the flame, and finally, plunging into the flame to be utterly consumed. True union is not to know *about* Allah, but to be effaced *in* Allah, becoming one with the Light that was once the object of one's longing

### Beings of Light and Smokeless Fire (Al-Malā'ikah wa-l-Jinn)

The Islamic cosmos is populated by various unseen beings who exist in dimensions subtler than our own. These are not the chaotic, malevolent entities of cosmic horror, but created beings with a defined nature and purpose within the Divine order.

* ***Malā'ikah***: The angels are beings created from pure light (*nūr*). They possess no free will and their existence is one of perfect, unwavering submission to the commands of Allah. They are the messengers, guardians, and administrators of the cosmos, the forces that uphold the Divine laws in every corner of creation  
* ***Jinn***: The jinn are beings created from a "smokeless fire" (*mārijin min nār*), a substance subtler than physical matter but denser than the light of the angels Crucially, like human beings, they possess free will (*ikhtiyār*). They are therefore capable of both belief and unbelief, righteousness and corruption. They live in a parallel dimension, typically within *'Ālam al-Malakūt*, and can at times interact with the human world. The Qur'an affirms that the arch-rebel, Iblīs, was one of the jinn, not a "fallen angel," as his rebellion stemmed from the arrogance made possible by free will. Understanding the jinn provides a coherent theological framework for unseen influences and "occultures" without resorting to a mythology of uncreated, primordial evil.  
* ***'Ālam al-Ghayb***: It is vital to distinguish between these created beings and *al-Ghayb* itself. *Al-Ghayb* refers to that which is concealed from human perception It is divided into two categories:  
1. ***Al-Ghayb al-Mutlaq***:This is known only to Allah. It includes the ultimate nature of His Essence and Attributes, the exact time of the Final Hour, and the deepest realities of existence  
2. ***Al-Ghayb al-Nisbi***: This is unseen to some but may be known to others. The world of the jinn and angels is in this category. While normally hidden from human senses, knowledge of it can be granted by Allah through revelation to His Prophets, peace be upon them, or through *kashf* to His *awliyā'*.

## 'Ilm al-Asrār

The cosmological map is of no use without a compass. The Science of Secrets provides the seeker with a grammar of action, a way to align the small currents of one's daily life with the great ocean of Divine Will. This is not a science of prediction, which seeks to bind the future, but a science of alignment, which seeks to unbind the heart in the present moment. It is a craft for the *awliyā'*, friends of Allah whose greatest protection is anonymity.

### The Ten Divine Thresholds and the Paired Names

The world of number is a reflection of the world of meaning. The ten primordial numbers, from zero to nine, are not mere quantities but qualities, thresholds where the Unseen touches the seen. We shall call them *Al-A'tāb al-'Asharah*.

These thresholds stand in five balanced pairings that always sum to nine, the number of fulfillment. These are the *Al-Asmā' al-Muzdawijah*, each a marriage of contrary Divine Attributes that together express a complete reality.

* 0 :: 9 — *Al-Awwal wa-l-Ākhir*, the First and the Last: The threshold of Origin and Fulfillment. It teaches the seeker to begin an act knowing that its completion is with Allah, and to complete an act knowing it is but the seed of a new beginning.  
* 1 :: 8 — *Al-Muḥyī wa-l-Mujīb*, the Giver of Life and the Comforter: The threshold of Invocation and Response. It is the singular call to Allah and the all-encompassing comfort of His answer. To work this pair is to remember on behalf of another and to console without noise.  
* 2 :: 7 — *Al-Khāliq wa-l-Ḥafīẓ*, the Creator and the Guardian: The threshold of Impetus and Care. It is the creative spark that brings a thing into being and the patient stewardship that nurtures it to maturity.  
* 3 :: 6 — *Ar-Razzāq wa-l-Fattāḥ*, the Provider and the Opener: The threshold of Providence and Surprise. It is the Divine plan that provides for all, and the unexpected opening that reveals a grace beyond the plan. To walk this path is to be available for holy interruption.  
* 4 :: 5 — *Al-Ḥakam wa-s-Salām*, the Judge and the Peace: The threshold of Discernment and Reconciliation. It is the clear judgment that establishes truth and the profound peace that heals all conflict.

### The River, the Key, and the Way

Between each of these Paired Names flows a current, the *Nahr al-Qadar*. Its strength is the difference between the two numbers. To stand in this river is to align oneself with the day's appointed spiritual labor.

Every name, every place, every moment has a *Miftāḥ*. This is found by the science of *'Ilm al-Ḥurūf*, reducing any word or number to its single-digit essence through its Abjad value. If the name of your city has an Abjad value 352, its Key is 1 (3+5+2=10; 1+0=1). This Key unlocks the hour; it is a focus for your breath, a number for a Divine Name to be recited.

*Aṭ-Ṭarīq* is the patient, stepwise path of this reduction. The Way is the sequence 352 → 10 → 1\. This is a prayer in itself, a small misbaha of attention that teaches the soul to move from the complex many to the simple One.

### 

### The Lawḥ al-A'māl and Ṣuḥbat al-Ghayb

For those who must communicate in situations of constraint, and in the alphabet of Rūm, there is a method of hiding mercy in plain sight. The *Lawḥ al-A'māl* is a grid of cells, mapping the six articles of faith to the six duties of the believer.

The Lawḥ al-A'māl (Table of Works)

|  | 1\. Shahādah (Testimony) | 2\. Ṣalāt (Prayer) | 3\. Zakāt (Charity) | 4\. Ṣawm (Fasting) | 5\. Ḥajj (Pilgrimage) | 6\. Jihād an-Nafs (Self-Struggle) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| A. Belief in Allah | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
| B. Belief in Angels | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | A | B |
| C. Belief in Books | C | D | E | F | G | H |
| D. Belief in Messengers | I | J | K | L | M | N |
| E. Belief in the Last Day | O | P | Q | R | S | T |
| F. Belief in Divine Decree | U | V | W | X | Y | Z |

A coordinate, "5B" tucked into a margin, becomes a hidden instruction: "Perform your pilgrimage with the awareness of the angels." The uninitiated sees a simple mark; a friend reads an appointment with Allah.

When many bind their days to these same invariants—the Paired Names, the Keys, the Tablet—their actions begin to harmonize without a signal ever being passed. This is *Ṣuḥbat al-Ghayb*. Your act of charity on a day of *Ar-Razzāq* may be the answer to a prayer uttered by a stranger miles away. The world calls it coincidence; we call it the secret conversation of the saints.

The Inner Alchemy

The outer sciences of alignment must be paired with the inner sciences of transformation. The human form is a microcosm, a temple containing its own celestial map. To journey to Allah is to journey through the sanctified geography of the self.

### Laṭā'if as-Sirr

The Subtle Centers of Light

The human spiritual anatomy contains subtle centers of consciousness, loci where the Divine attributes are received and polished. These are the *Laṭā'if*, or Subtle Centers of Light. They mark the ascent from the dense self to the rarefied spirit.

1. *Qālab* (the mold) \- Located at the base of the spine, this is the center of our elemental, physical nature. Its purification is grounding and stability.  
2. *Nafs* (the self) \- Located below the navel, this is the seat of the lower self and its desires. Its purification is the transformation of raw passion into spiritual longing.  
3. *Qalb* (the heart) \- Located at the solar plexus, this is the center of will and personal power. Its purification is the alignment of one's will with the Divine Will.  
4. *Rūḥ* (the spirit) \- Located at the physical heart, this is the center of higher consciousness and selfless love. Its purification opens the soul to Divine compassion.  
5. *Sirr* (the secret) \- Located at the throat, this is the center of intimate communion with the Divine. Its purification allows one to speak truth with the breath of the Spirit.  
6. *Khafī* (the hidden) \- Located between the eyebrows, this is the center of spiritual intuition and direct witnessing. Its purification is the opening of the "third eye" of the heart.  
7. *Akhfā* (the hiddenmost) \- Located at the crown of the head, this is the point of *fanā'* and *baqā'* in Allah. It is the gateway to Unity.

### Maqāmāt al-Istighrāq

The Stations of Absorption

Through cultivating  deep concentration in *murāqabah*, the *sālik* can enter states of spiritual absorption where the ordinary world falls away. These stations are a ladder of ascent from the ecstasy of remembrance to the profound peace of annihilation.

1. *Wajd*, The Station of Ecstasy: The first absorption arises from focused *dhikr*. An overwhelming joy erupts, a panic of bliss, as spiritual pleasure floods the mind. The inner voice is still present, but it is captivated by the divine beauty.  
2. *Ghaybah*, The Station of Absence: The initial rapture settles into effortless, one-pointed joy. Here, the inner chatter completely subsides. Attention is glued to the object of meditation, sustained by a profound happiness.  
3. *Riḍā,* The Station of Contentment: The ecstatic bliss refines into a deep, quiet contentment. The thrill is replaced by an unshakable ease and satisfaction. The soul is like a still lake suffused with a gentle light.  
4. *Sakīnah,* The Station of Tranquility: The pinnacle of the "form" absorptions. All traces of pleasure and pain vanish, leaving a pristine, neutral peace. The breath may become so subtle as to be imperceptible. The self-narrative is completely absent. This state is the foundation for the highest unveilings.  
5. *'Ālam al-Mithāl,* The Station of Boundless Space: The first "formless" absorption. Attention expands beyond the body to embrace the infinite expanse of the imaginal realm. The sense of location dissolves.  
6. *Shuhūd,* The Station of Boundless Consciousness: Awareness turns upon itself, recognizing its own limitless nature. The distinction between observer and observed dissolves into a luminous, unified field of knowing.  
7. *Fanā' aṣ-Ṣifāt,* The Station of Nothingness: Attention shifts to the absence of all things. The *sālik* enters a peaceful, restful void, where awareness remains, aware only of nothingness. This is the Annihilation in the Divine Attributes.  
8. *Fanā' adh-Dhāt*, The Station of Utter Annihilation: The subtlest state, the very threshold of consciousness. It is a state so refined it is described as "neither perception nor non-perception," the final annihilation in the Divine Essence before the return to *baqā'* in Allah.

### Naẓar al-Kashf

The Gaze of Unveiling

A mind sharpened by absorption is the perfect instrument for *firāsah*. This is the Gaze of Unveiling, which pierces the illusions of the world to see *al-Ḥaqq*. This practice focuses on the direct perception of the three fundamental truths of existence.

* *Dawām at-Taġhayyur*, Perpetual Change: The *sālik* observes the constant arising and passing away of all sensations, thoughts, and phenomena. Nothing holds still. This direct perception of impermanence is the experiential doorway to understanding *fanā'*, the truth that all things are "perishing save His Face." (Qur'an)  
* *Al-Iftiqār*, Essential Poverty: The *sālik* observes the subtle suffering (*dukkha*) that arises from clinging to or resisting fleeting experiences. This reveals the essential neediness and dependency of all creation, leading to the realization that only Allah is truly Self-Sufficient (*Al-Ghanī*).  
* *Tanzīh an-Nafs*, Transcending the Self: The *sālik* deconstructs the moment-to-moment flow of experience, searching for the permanent, independent "I" that is believed to be in control. None is found. Intentions, thoughts, and actions are seen to arise on their own, conditioned by causes. This unveils the illusion of the separate self and reveals the One True Actor, *al-Fā'il al-Ḥaqīqī*.

## Al-Insān al-Kāmil

The Polished Mirror

The final destination of this journey into the *baṭn*—the interior of the Earth and the interior of the self—is the realization of the station of *Al-Insān al-Kāmil*. This is the human being who has successfully traversed all the stations of the *nafs*, whose heart has been so thoroughly polished by the constant remembrance of Allah that it has become a flawless mirror. In this mirror, all the Divine Names and Attributes are reflected without distortion.

The *Insān al-Kāmil* is the microcosm who contains the macrocosm, the purpose for which creation was brought into being. They are the living proof of the Hadith of the Hidden Treasure. The *sālik* who begins the journey by excavating the dark, hidden "oil" of the Divine Essence within themselves ultimately becomes a radiant lamp, a perfect manifestation of the Hidden Treasure they once sought. They do not merely find the Beloved; they become the very eye through which the Beloved sees, the tongue through which the Beloved speaks, and the hand through which the Beloved acts in the world. This is the ultimate unveiling, where the journey ends where it began: in the all-encompassing reality of the One.

Be warned, oh sālik: this is no journey for the faint-hearted. It will change you forever, just as it changed Ḥazqiyāl, peace be upon him. The method, though obscure, is shockingly simple: \[تم مسح البيانات\]
