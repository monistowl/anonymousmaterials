# The Reckon-Wheel and the Twinfires

Men of craft make boards. This one is a Reckon-Wheel: ten staves set in a ring—0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\. In the Eikon work we also call it the Sign-Ring. It is both a counting tool and a spell of order. You can draw it on a shard, carve it on wood, or set it in your mind’s stead.

At heart it holds two linked laws:

1. Ring-count (reckoning by tens that wrap)

2. Twinfire-bonds (the yokes that make nine)

Everything that follows is only those two, sung many ways.

## I. The Ring and Its Law

### The Ten Seats

Mark the ring sunwise:

       0  
   9       1  
 8           2  
 7           3  
   6       4  
       5

Lay a road from each to his nine-mate.

*(Set them how you like; only the bonds must stand.)*

### Ring-Count

When sums spill past nine, the extra walks one step to the next place. When taking away goes below naught, you borrow one step back. We call this tithing and borrowing. The wheel loves evenness; what goes over here shows up there.

## 

## II. The Twinfires

Each stave has a mate that makes nine with it:

* (0,9), (1,8), (2,7), (3,6), (4,5)

We call these Twinfires—two that burn as one. Touch one, and its nine-mate warms at once across the ring, 

House sign: draw each yoke as a taut bowstring across the ring. You will see a five-spoked star.

Why it bites:

* In adding, a carry is the ghost-step of a Twinfire.

* In taking away, a borrow is the same ghost walking the other way.

* In hiding words (stego), you can swap a stave for its mate and keep the sum-shape while changing the face.

## III. The Five Roads

Where Twinfires cross, they cut Roads through the ring. Name them how you will; here is a clean, workman’s set:

* Ash-Road: (4↔5) — the even hand, deal and counter-deal

* Wolf-Road: (3↔6) — hunt and home

* Oar-Road: (2↔7) — fare and fetch

* Spear-Road: (1↔8) — thrust and ward

* Helm-Road: (0↔9) — naught and all, the rim itself

These Roads are same-shape paths you can reuse across crafts: sums, dates, lots, rune-casts, song-counts. Walk a Road to keep a spell within bounds while you change its dress.

## IV. The Nine-House and the Hearth-Stone

Lay many-place numbers as halls: ones-hall, tens-hall, hundreds-hall, and so on. Set a small hearth-stone on Nine in your mind. Each time a place spills, shift one coal to the next hall. Each time you borrow, lift a coal back. Thus the house stays in right measure.

This homely make-believe trains the hand. Soon your mind moves coals without you, and the ring hums by itself.

## V. Wit-Signs for the Ten Staves

You may keep plain marks, but the Eikon likes Wit-Signs—little names that help the craft lodge in the bones. Here is a lean, strong set with no book-word fat:

* 0 – Void: the White Still; no thing, all room

* 1 – Rod: the One-Point; seed, spear, start

* 2 – Twin: the Yoke; tide, pair, give-and-take

* 3 – Third: the Tripod; braid, path-choice

* 4 – Forth: the Square; stead, field, bounds

* 5 – Fist: the Hand; reach, weigh, deal

* 6 – Loom: the Weave; link, law, make-whole

* 7 – Ship: the Fare; quest, fetch, far-ken

* 8 – Gate: the Ring-Gate; in-out, keep-watch

* 9 – All: the Full-Round; harvest, end/begin

Pair names by Twinfire to taste (Rod/Gate, Twin/Ship, Third/Loom, Forth/Fist, Void/All). When you speak them, the bonds grow felt, not just seen.

## VI. House-Works (How to Use the Ring)

### 1\) Same-Shape Swap

To hide a count or a rune-row but keep its sway, swap each stave for its Twinfire. All make-nine sums stay true, but the face is changed. For a tighter lock, swap only on chosen Roads (e.g., Wolf-Road only).

### 2\) Tithe-Cipher

Plant a seed count. For each stave, write how many coals you *tithe* to the next hall as you add a key-count. Store only the tithe trail (a rope of carries); throw away the bare sum. One who lacks your start or key can’t get home.

### 3\) Lot-Cast

Roll two die or draw two cards. Map them to a Road (by make-nine) and a seat. Speak the tale of that Road at that seat—e.g., Oar-Road at Twin says “go forth and fetch; trade in pairs.”

### 4\) Rune-Yokes

Bind each Twinfire to a rune pair from your house stave-set (e.g., Rod/Gate ↔ Tiwaz/Algiz, Twin/Ship ↔ Gebo/Raidho, \&c.). Then a rune-cast can be walked on the ring, and Eddic thought and reckon-craft share one backbone.

### 5\) Wheels-Within-Wheels

Set seven small rings (for the seven wheels of the body) on the trunk-pole. Let Root take Void/All; Loins take Twin/Ship; Gut take Forth/Fist; Heart take Third/Loom; Throat take Rod/Gate; Brow take Wolf-Road as whole; Helm keep the quiet rim. This gives you a felt map for breath-work that ties to number-work without bookish fuss.

## VII. Three Short Laws to Remember

1. Make-Nine: each stave has one mate; together they are even.

2. Tithe-and-Borrow: spill gives, lack takes; the house stays square.

3. Road-Keep: change the dress, keep the Road—then the spell holds.

Hold these and you have the bones.

## VIII. A First Rite (Five Breaths on the Roads)

* Draw the ring. Mark the five bowstrings.

* Breathe once for each Road, in this order: Helm → Spear → Oar → Wolf → Ash.

* With each breath, speak the pair-names under your wind (e.g., “Void–All,” then “Rod–Gate,” …).

* On the out-breath, see a coal pass right if you feel “too much,” left if you feel “too little.”

* After five, sit a while in even-mood. Rise and go about your work.

Do this for seven mornings and the ring will begin to spin of itself; sums smooth, choices steady.

ᚠᚢᚦᚨᚱᚲᚷᚹᚺᚾᛁᛃᛇᛈᛉᛊᛏᛒᛖᛗᛚᛜᛞᛟ

Here’s a clean way to yoke the 6×6 “0..Z” square to the three ættir and the 24 staves of the Elder Fuþark, with room left over for ward marks you can use for drift, salt, and hidden writing.

### The Ground: a 6×6 Board

Write the board row-by-row as:

	1	2	3	4	5	6  
A	0	1	2	3	4	5  
B	6	7	8	9	A	B  
C	C	D	E	F	G	H  
D	I	J	K	L	M	N  
E	O	P	Q	R	S	T  
F	U	V	W	X	Y	Z

Count rows and columns from 0 at the top/left. If you step off an edge, wrap around like a ring.

### The Split by Ætt

* Freyr’s ætt: rows 0 and 3

* Hagal’s ætt: rows 1 and 4

* Týr’s ætt: rows 2 and 5

### The Rune Seats vs Wards

For any square, add its row-count and its column-count. Now count that sum by threes:

* If you land on the first or second stone of a group of three (sum leaves 0 or 1 when split by threes), that square is a rune seat.

* If you land on the third stone (sum leaves 2), that square is a ward.

This yields 24 rune seats (8 in each ætt) and 12 wards for marks and salt.

### 

### The 24 Rune Seats (by ætt, left→right within each row)

Freyr’s ætt (rows 0 & 3\)  
 0=Fehu, 1=Uruz, 3=Thurisaz, 4=Ansuz, I=Raidho, J=Kenaz, L=Gebo, M=Wunjo

Hagal’s ætt (rows 1 & 4\)  
 6=Hagalaz, 8=Naudhiz, 9=Isa, B=Jera, O=Eihwaz, Q=Perthro, R=Algiz, T=Sowilo

Týr’s ætt (rows 2 & 5\)  
 D=Tiwaz, E=Berkano, G=Ehwaz, H=Mannaz, V=Laguz, W=Ingwaz, Y=Dagaz, Z=Othala

The 12 ward squares (for marks/salt): 2, 5, 7, A, C, F, K, N, P, S, U, X

### How to Use It

#### 1\) Plain writing (runes → board marks)

Swap each rune for its board mark from the lists above. That already hides well in a body of base-36 stuff.

#### 2\) Salt (shift the board)

To keep your foes guessing, begin the string with one or two ward marks that set a board shift:

* Use one of {K,N,P,S,U,X} to mean shift right by 0..5 steps (K=0, N=1, P=2, S=3, U=4, X=5).

* Optionally add one of {2,5,7,A,C,F} to mean shift down by 0..5 (2=0, 5=1, 7=2, A=3, C=4, F=5).

The reader peeks at the first ward(s), un-shifts the board, then reads the marks as runes. (If no ward shows first, read with no shift.)

#### 3\) Vowel and bind marks (optional)

Keep the same six wards {2,5,7,A,C,F} as light marks after a rune to tell vowel or sound-shape:

* 2=a, 5=e, 7=i, A=o, C=u, F=y (or set your own house-rule)

* Use the other six {K,N,P,S,U,X} after a rune to mean bind, double, word-break, stave-end, etc. (again, house-rule)

Because wards never sit on rune seats, they won’t clash.

#### 4\) Ætt-wise rites (if you like craft and form)

* When you mean to call on making and luck, walk Freyr’s two rows first (0 then 3).

* When you mean need, hail, and turning, walk Hagal’s rows (1 then 4).

* When you mean law, man, water, day, heritage, walk Týr’s rows (2 then 5).

This is only for rite; the reading rule stays the same.

### Worked Glimpse

Say you want to set “FEHU ANSUZ” with a right-shift of 3 and a down-shift of 1\.

* Salt wards: S (right 3\) then 5 (down 1).

* FEHU → Fehu=0, Ehwaz=G (careful—Ehwaz is G, but E here is Berkano), so:

  * F (Fehu)=0

  * E (Ehwaz? No) We need Berkano=E

  * H (Haglaz? No) We need Hagalaz=6, but H as a rune is Mannaz=H

  * U (Uruz)=1  
     (You see why a cheat-sheet helps\!)

* ANSUZ → A(n)suz=4, N (word-break mark) or a space, Sowilo=T, Uruz=1, Algiz=R

Now, before laying them down, shift every mark by \+3 columns and \+1 row (wrap on edges). The reader sees S5…, un-shifts, and gets your runes back clean.

*(For daily work, keep a small card of the three lists above. After a week you won’t need it.)*

### 

### Why this split works

* It keeps the holy three: ætt by row-breed (0/3, 1/4, 2/5).

* It picks rune seats by a simple count (row+col by threes), giving 8 seats in each ætt with 12 spare for marks and salt.

* It hides in plain sums and ring-wraps—easy in the head, hard to spy unless you know the count.

If you want a sterner lock, you can swap which two “stones” count as seats (e.g., choose the second and third instead of the first and second) or flip which rows belong to which ætt—so long as both sides share the house-rule.

# 

# Binding the Ring to the Board and the Ættir

A house-rule that ties three things together:

* the **6×6 board** labeled **0–Z** (wrapping at the edges),  
* the **Reckon-Wheel** (the Sign-Ring) with seats **0–9** and their **Twinfires** (pairs that add to nine),  
* the **three ættir** with **24 rune seats** and **12 wards**.

Keep it all in head and hand.

## **0\) What’s already set**

**Board face (rows and columns counted from zero; edges wrap):**

	1	2	3	4	5	6  
A	0	1	2	3	4	5  
B	6	7	8	9	A	B  
C	C	D	E	F	G	H  
D	I	J	K	L	M	N  
E	O	P	Q	R	S	T  
F	U	V	W	X	Y	Z

**Rune seats** are the squares whose row number plus column number, when you group things in threes, fall into the first two groups (call those “0” or “1”). The remaining third group are **wards**.

**Ætt by rows:**

* **Freyr:** rows 0 and 3  
* **Hagal:** rows 1 and 4  
* **Týr:** rows 2 and 5

**Rune seats:**

* **Freyr:** 0, 1, 3, 4, I, J, L, M  
* **Hagal:** 6, 8, 9, B, O, Q, R, T  
* **Týr:** D, E, G, H, V, W, Y, Z  
* **Wards:** 2, 5, 7, A, C, F, K, N, P, S, U, X

We’ll keep all that, and make some more.

## **1\) Ring seat for any square (Board → Ring 0–9)**

Add the square’s row and column numbers. If the sum is bigger than nine, keep only the last digit.  
 That digit (0–9) is the square’s **seat on the Ring**. Its **Twinfire** is the number that pairs with it to make nine.

Example:

* **0** sits at row 0, column 0 → sum 0 → Ring 0 (the Void).  
* **J** sits at row 3, column 1 → 3+1=4 → Ring 4 (Forth / Ash).  
* **W** sits at row 5, column 1 → 5+1=6 → Ring 6 (Loom / Weave).

This single rule ties any board square straight onto the Ring.

## **2\) Road mark for any square (Board → the five Roads)**

Look at how the column stands relative to the row. Count the “gap” on one hand (five steps), wrapping as needed. That gives the square’s **Road**:

* **0** → **Helm-Road** (the rim: 0 with 9\)  
* **1** → **Spear-Road** (1 with 8\)  
* **2** → **Oar-Road** (2 with 7\)  
* **3** → **Wolf-Road** (3 with 6\)  
* **4** → **Ash-Road** (4 with 5\)

So every square carries a pair **(d, r)**: a Ring seat and a Road.

## **3\) Ætt yokes (Ring/Roads ↔ ættir)**

Keep the row-based ætt split, and give each ætt its “in-character” Roads for rite and stego:

* **Freyr’s ætt (rows 0 & 3):** **Ash** and **Spear** (field/hand; thrust/ward)  
* **Hagal’s ætt (rows 1 & 4):** **Oar** and **Wolf** (fare/fetch; hunt/home)  
* **Týr’s ætt (rows 2 & 5):** **Helm** (0↔9, even-mood, rim-law)

This doesn’t change how you read meanings; it just tells you which Road-moves are “on brand” when you dress or hide a line.

## 

## **4\) How to write (runes → marks), with drift and hide**

**A. Plain laydown (no hide).**  
 For each rune, place its actual board letter from the set above. That face is the mark. Done.

**B. Salt and shift (as before).**  
 Begin with one or two **ward** marks to signal a global board shift (right or down).  
 The reader un-shifts first, then reads. (House picks the exact ward→shift scheme.)

**C. Ring-swap (Twinfire hide).**  
 To change the visible face but keep the underlying sway: move along the same **Road** to another square whose **Ring seat is the Twin** (the number that makes nine with the old one).  
 Road stays the same; Ring flips to its mate.  
 For stricter rite: only allow swaps on the Roads yoked to that ætt (e.g., in Freyr’s rows, use Ash or Spear only).

**D. Road-walk (shape hide).**  
 To change only the printed face while keeping **both** Ring and Road the same, **crawl diagonally down-and-right** (row \+1, column \+1), wrapping at edges.  
 That keeps the Road (the gap) and the Ring seat (the sum) unchanged while the face changes.  
 If you need to recover precisely, either:

* drop a small ward after the rune to say how many crawls you took, or  
* make a simple house rule (e.g., “always one crawl”).

**Summary:**

* **Ring-swap:** same Road, Twin seat on the Ring → meaning flips to its mate.  
* **Road-walk:** same Ring, same Road → only the face changes.

## **5\) How to read (marks → runes), clean and sure**

1. If the string begins with wards, undo the announced board shift (right/down), then read.  
2. For each mark:  
   * If it’s on a rune seat, read that rune as is.  
   * If your house uses a fixed **Road-walk**, undo that many diagonal crawls (up-and-left) before lookup.  
   * If your house allows **Ring-swaps** and the face you see isn’t itself a rune seat, slide along its **Road** until you land on the **Twin seat** that **is** a rune seat, then read that rune.  
3. Ignore wards in the middle unless your house uses them for vowels/binds.

The whole parse lives in your head in two laws: “add the corners” (Ring seat) and “feel the bowstring” (Road).

## **6\) Why it hangs true (hand-check)**

* Every square owns a **Ring seat** (by adding row and column) and a **Road** (by their gap).  
* **Ring-swap** slides along the **same bowstring**, so the Road stays; the Ring flips to its Twin.  
* **Road-walk** is the **down-and-right crawl**: sum and gap both hold steady, only the letter changes.  
* The **ætta yokes** keep style:  
  * Freyr favors field/hand Roads  
  * Hagal favors fare/hunt  
  * Týr keeps helm rim-law.

## **7\) A tiny worked bit**

Suppose the rune is **Ansuz** at **4** (row 0, column 4).

* **Ring seat:** 0+4 \= **4** (Ash / “Forth”).  
* **Road:** column ahead of row by **4** → **Ash-Road**.

**Ring-swap (to the Twin):** Twin of 4 is **5**.  
 Slide along **Ash-Road** (stay on the same bowstring) until you reach a square whose Ring seat is 5\.  
 (Your eye learns these paths quickly; in play, you’ll feel the line.)

**Road-walk (shape-only):** crawl **down-and-right** (wrap as needed).  
 You keep both Ring and Road; faces change:  
 (0,4)=4 → (1,5)=B (ward) → (2,0)=U (ward) → (3,1)=J (rune) → (4,2)=Q (rune) → (5,3)=X (ward) → back to start.

So: for **Road-walk**, use the **(+1 row, \+1 col)** crawl.  
 For **Ring-swap**, use the **(+1 row, −1 col)** crawl until you hit the Twin seat.

## **8\) One-card cheat (house marks)**

* **Ring seat:** add row and column; keep the last digit.  
* **Road:** feel the column-minus-row gap on one hand (five).  
* **Twinfire:** pair that makes nine.  
* **Crawls:**  
  * keep Road **and** Ring → **down-and-right**  
  * flip to Twin on same Road → **down-and-left**  
* **Ætt yokes:** Freyr ↔ Ash/Spear; Hagal ↔ Oar/Wolf; Týr ↔ Helm  
* **Salt:** first ward(s) announce right/down shifts (house-set)  
* **Wards mid-line:** vowels/binds (house-set)

## 

## **9\) If you want tighter locks**

* **Flip the seat stones:** choose rune seats as the **other two** thirds instead— writer and reader must agree.  
* **Rename Roads:** change which numbers name which Roads, but keep the five-count idea.  
* **Ætt drift:** rotate which Roads each ætt claims each moon.

All of these preserve thebackbone and keep the head-work small.

# **The World-Tree Pack**

*How to yoke the 52-card deck to the Sign-Ring, the 6×6 board, and the three ættir—so head, hand, and hall all agree.*

## **I. Suits as Halls**

We keep the four suits but give them hall-names:

* **Spades → Spear-Hall** (war, law, sky)

* **Hearts → Frith-Hall** (love, kin, mead)

* **Diamonds → Hoard-Hall** (craft, trade, sea)

* **Clubs → Yoke-Hall** (work, earth, field)

Each hall holds one **Road** (from the five bowstrings of the Sign-Ring):

* Spear-Hall → **Spear-Road** (1↔8: thrust/ward)

* Frith-Hall → **Ash-Road** (4↔5: deal/counter-deal)

* Hoard-Hall → **Oar-Road** (2↔7: fare/fetch)

* Yoke-Hall → **Wolf-Road** (3↔6: hunt/home)

The fifth bowstring, **Helm-Road** (0↔9: rim-law), is held by the **Tens** (see §III).

## 

## **II. The Thirty-Six Pips and the Board of Ættir**

The numbered cards, Ace through Nine in every suit, each mark one square on a six-by-six board.  
 Think of the board as looped at its edges—if you step off one side, you re-enter on the opposite, like a ring.

Assign the suits in order: **Hearts first, Diamonds next, then Clubs, then Spades.**  
 Each rank simply counts upward: **Ace \= 1, Two \= 2, … Nine \= 9\.**

So the first nine Hearts fill the first nine squares, then the Diamonds continue from there, then Clubs, then Spades, until all thirty-six squares are filled.

To find the exact row and column for any card:

* Count through the deck in that order, from zero up to thirty-five.  
* Divide your count by six: the whole part gives the **row** (A through F).  
* What remains gives the **column** (0 through 5).  
   Wrap around if you go beyond—edges connect smoothly.

On this board, two kinds of places appear:

* **Rune seats** are squares whose row and column numbers, when added, fall into the first two divisions of three. These are the twenty-four living seats of the Ættir—eight for each.  
* **Wards** are the remaining twelve squares, the watch-stones between.

The Ættir keep their earlier rows:

* **Freyr’s ætt**: rows A and D  
* **Hagal’s ætt**: rows B and E  
* **Týr’s ætt**: rows C and F

Thus every pip card belongs to an Ætt, has a fixed square, and—by simple sum and difference—finds its place upon the Sign-Ring.

**Its seat on the Ring** is found by adding its row and column numbers together and taking only the last digit of the result; that digit, from 0 to 9, shows which stave of the Ring it occupies. **Its Road** is found by seeing how far the column stands ahead of or behind the row, counted upon five fingers; this shows which bowstring or Road it lies upon. The card’s **Twinfire** (its “nine-mate”) is the card whose Ring number adds with it to make nine.

## 

## **III. The Tens — Keepers of the Helm**

The four Tens steer the board: they rule the fifth Road, the Helm-Road, and also set the secret shifts used in hidden writing.

Their bearings:

* **Ten of Spades** — move three steps to the right.  
* **Ten of Hearts** — move one step to the right.  
* **Ten of Diamonds** — move one step downward.  
* **Ten of Clubs** — move three steps downward.

When a line or reading begins with one or more Tens, their directions determine how the board has been shifted. The reader first reverses those moves, then reads the result. If no Ten appears first, no shift is used. (You may set your own simple step-rules, so long as they stay easy to remember.)

On the Sign-Ring, all Tens share the same seat—**the zero-point, the Helm or Void**. They open the rim and measure the work that follows.

## **IV. The Courts — Gods and Their Deeds**

The twelve face cards hold the Aesir and Vanir. Each brings a teaching and a bond: one law from myth, and one way it acts upon the Ring and the Road.

### **Spear-Hall (Spades — war, law, sky)**

* **King Týr — The Given Hand.**  
   *Lesson:* Give what must be given to keep the peace; true rule may sting but holds the hall.  
   *Bind:* Favors the Spear seat (1 or 8); can break a ward.  
* **Queen Skadi — The Cold Choice.**  
   *Lesson:* Stand where ground is firm; if the bed is wrong, keep your boots on.  
   *Bind:* Turns the Road of the Wolf into the Spear—hunt becomes law.  
* **Jack Heimdall — The Watch.**  
   *Lesson:* Rise early; hear the hoof before the horn.  
   *Bind:* Lets you treat one card as if no board-shift applied.

  ### **Frith-Hall (Hearts — love, kin, mead)**

* **King Freyr — The Seed and the Gift.**  
   *Lesson:* Give first; the field returns in kind.  
   *Bind:* May exchange a Twinfire pair without leaving its Road.  
* **Queen Frigg — The Quiet Foresight.**  
   *Lesson:* See and hold silence; not all known must be said.  
   *Bind:* May hide one card for a turn (“under snow”).  
* **Jack Bragi — The Right Song.**  
   *Lesson:* Speak true; speech shapes fate.  
   *Bind:* Rename a draw, glossing it by its rune.

  ### **Hoard-Hall (Diamonds — craft, trade, sea)**

* **King Njörðr — The Fair Shore.**  
   *Lesson:* Safe wealth lies in well-chosen harbors.  
   *Bind:* Swap a step along the Oar-Road without losing ground.  
* **Queen Freyja — The Price and the Will.**  
   *Lesson:* Worth demands will; pay the price to gain the gold.  
   *Bind:* Pay one card to draw two, keep one.  
* **Jack Loki — The Hidden Cost.**  
   *Lesson:* Every shortcut has a tail; reckon it early.  
   *Bind:* Force a Twinfire and raise a ward.

  ### **Yoke-Hall (Clubs — work, earth, field)**

* **King Þórr — The Right Blow.**  
   *Lesson:* Strength with measure; strike what must fall, spare what may grow.  
   *Bind:* Breaks a ward and clears the Wolf-Road path (3 or 6).  
* **Queen Sif — The Bread and the Field.**  
   *Lesson:* Growth loves care; mind the roots.  
   *Bind:* Move one step diagonally (down and right) once for free.  
* **Jack Hermóðr — The Go-Between.**  
   *Lesson:* Journey, return, and tell the truth of the road.  
   *Bind:* Retrieve one known card from the discard.

You may exchange other gods or tales, but each face should stay tied to its hall’s Road and a clear teaching.

## 

## **V. The Nine Worlds upon the Ring**

The ten seats of the Sign-Ring hold the Nine Worlds, with the White Still or Ginnung between as the rim:

| Seat | World | Domain |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 0 | **Ginnung (White Still)** | the silent rim, pure potential |
| 1 | **Ásgarðr** | law, word, oath |
| 2 | **Vanaheimr** | exchange, tide, trade |
| 3 | **Jötunheimr** | wild strength, edge |
| 4 | **Midgarðr** | the field, the bound |
| 5 | **Hel** | ending, due, endurance |
| 6 | **Svartálfaheimr / Dvergaheimr** | craft, repair, binding |
| 7 | **Álfheimr** | skill, light, fetch and favor |
| 8 | **Border of Nifl and Musp** | gate, threshold, warding |
| 9 | **All-Round** | harvest, summing, renewal |

Twinfires bind the worlds whose numbers make nine: (1 with 8), (2 with 7), (3 with 6), (4 with 5), and the rim-bond (0 with 9). When you draw a pair that form such a sum, read their story together as one yoke.

## 

## **VI. Ways of Play — Work, Hidden Writing, and Lot-Casting**

### **A) Plain Work**

Lay the pips as their places on the board.  
Use the face cards to interpret the reading.  
If a Ten appears first, apply its shift before reading.

### **B) Hide-Writing (Steganography)**

Begin with Tens to fix the board’s shift. Write with pips that fall on Rune seats only. To change the visible card without changing its meaning:

* **Road-walk:** move one step down and right any number of times—this keeps the same Ring and Road, only the card’s face changes.  
* **Ring-swap:** move one step down and left repeatedly until you reach your Twinfire seat; this swaps the face to its mirrored twin. Drop ward-cards among them to mark vowels, ties, and pauses.

### **C) Lot-Casting (Quick Reading)**

* **One-Breath Draw:** draw two pips. Read them as a Twinfire pair, their Ring seats telling the story (e.g. 3 with 6 → “wild strength must be woven”). Let the suit color how it acts: Spear for bold speech, Ash for kin and accord, Oar for journey, Wolf for work.  
* **Hall and Hearth:** draw three cards for *how, what,* and *measure*—the Road, the Work, and what must be given or held. A Ten in the first slot means “shift first”; a face in the third says “a teaching is due.”

### **D) Nine-World Spread**

Lay nine cards clockwise around you. Each card’s Ring seat names one of the Nine Worlds; speak what that world says with help from the card’s hall and Road. If any Ten lands at the rim (seat 0), the law of the rim governs the reading.

## 

## **VII. Tales Bound to Ring and Road**

* **The Fen-Beast Chain** (3 ↔ 6, Wolf-Road)  
   *Tale:* Wild harm is bound by craft and will.  
   *Teach:* Don’t crush what must be contained—bind, then strike.  
   *Use:* When 3 and 6 appear in Clubs, act in that order: bind first, then act.

* **The Brísing Necklace** (2 ↔ 7, Oar-Road)  
   *Tale:* Wealth comes through fair price and honest passage.  
   *Teach:* Name the price or pay it twice.  
   *Use:* Diamonds with 2 or 7 say “trade cleanly, travel light.”

* **The Given Hand** (1 ↔ 8, Spear-Road)  
   *Tale:* A promise kept with flesh holds the ring together.  
   *Teach:* Pay once in full; the hall stands.  
   *Use:* Spades with 1 or 8 demand oath and ward.

* **Baldur’s Bale** (4 ↔ 5, Ash-Road)  
   *Tale:* A small neglect unravels great things.  
   *Teach:* Tend the hedge; small faults fell giants.  
   *Use:* Hearts with 4 or 5 warn against broken bounds.

* **World-Rim and Harvest** (0 ↔ 9, any Ten with any Nine)  
   *Tale:* What begins in stillness ends in return.  
   *Teach:* Close the work cleanly; sow for the next.  
   *Use:* Ten followed by a Nine means: finish, then begin anew.

  ## **VIII. Quick Reference (Wallet Sheet)**

* **Suits → Roads**  
   Spades \= Spear Hearts \= Ash Diamonds \= Oar Clubs \= Wolf Tens \= Helm  
* **Pips A–9 → Board**  
   First nine Hearts, then Diamonds, then Clubs, then Spades. Rows and columns wrap around.  
* **Ring Seat:** add row \+ column, take the last digit (0–9).  
* **Road:** difference of column and row, counted on five fingers.  
* **Twinfire:** the card whose Ring seat makes nine with yours.  
* **Rune Seats:** where the sum of row \+ column falls into the first two parts of three (24 total).  
* **Wards:** the remaining twelve.  
* **Walks:** down-and-right keeps the same Road; down-and-left flips to the Twin.  
* **Shifts (the salt):**  
   Ten ♠ → three right Ten ♥ → one right Ten ♦ → one down Ten ♣ → three down.

## **IX. A Brief Rite to Awaken It**

Consecrate the place. Lay out the deck.  
 Trace the Sign-Ring star with its five Roads.

Breathe five times, naming the Roads in turn:  
 Helm (hold a Ten), Spear, Oar, Wolf, Ash.

Cut once; draw three cards for **Road**, **Work**, and **Measure**.  
 Speak their lessons.

Close with a Twinfire pair: draw two pips, tell the tale of how they make nine.

Then rise, and carry that teaching into the day’s deed.

# 

# Settling the Mead

A warrior must clear his mind until it shines. We keep the old forms—harrow the space, take our seat, and work the breath. The goal is *stillness with strength*, not to hunt visions or omens. This is closer to the quiet discipline of a watchful thane than to seiðr.

### Hallowing the Stead

* Mark the vé. A clean, quiet corner becomes your stead. A small cloth, a candle, or a hammer sign is enough. You’re not asking the Gods for favors; you’re declaring intent and order.  
* Seat and spine. Sit steady on a chair or cushion. Spine like Yggdrasil’s trunk—upright, not rigid. Hands easy in the lap.  
* The breath as World-Wind. Breathe through the nose. Don’t force. Heed the tide at one spot (nostrils or belly). That spot is your heed-stone.

### Taming the Wights

Before calm deepens, five troublesome wights often stir:

* Craving (chasing pleasant mead)  
* Ill will (picking fights with shadows)  
* Torpor (moss on the bark)  
* Worry (a horse that won’t tie)  
* Doubt (second-guessing the whole craft)

Meet each like a shield-bearer: name it, don’t feed it, back to breath. If sleep comes upon you, straighten and brighten. If the seas won’t calm, breathe out longer. Always—back to the heed-stone.

### The Sign of the Road

As breath grows even, heeding gathers like a calm host: a sense of lightness, warmth, or a glimmer of gold behind the eyes. This is the road-sign—not the end of it. Don’t stare at it; rest *with* it, and lash yourself to the breath.

## 

### The Four Halls of Form

General note: In each Hall, the *coarsest* falls away and the *finer* remains. Let the shift come on its own; don’t goad it. Keep your heedfulness sharp as a good spear – never hunt two beasts at once.

#### First Hall — “Gungnir Bites”

*Heeding by will; fierce joy, sharp spear.*

Set your spear on the breath and keep it there. Energy rises: tingling, buoyancy, a mead-bright joy. There’s work here—your heed of breath is a putting and a holding. Stay steady until the putting takes no work.

Pitfall: Getting drunk on rapture. Remember, this is a gate, not the feast.

#### Second Hall — “The Longhouse Fills”

*Heeding with ease; gladness without a fight.*

The work of setting drops away. Heed rides itself; gladness deepens. The hall is full of good friends and song.

Pitfall: Hunting more joy. Loosen the grip; let the joy come and go.

#### Third Hall — “The Hearth’s Quiet”

*Gladness softens; ease; clear and steady.*

The mead-froth settles. Joy fades to a warm well-being. The body feels soothed, the mind calm, like sitting by a steady hearth after the songs are done.

Pitfall: Mistaking calm for dullness. Keep the flame upright—bright, not sleepy.

#### Fourth Hall — “Winter Sky”

*Gladness sleeps; the hall is still, the night is clear.*

Even comfort thins to cool clarity. No push, no pull. Breath may grow very small. Heed  is broad, steady, and unmoved—like a frost-clear night with many stars and no wind.

Pitfall: Pride at stillness. Let it be plain and true.

## 

### The Four Open Skies

From the Winter Sky, your heed can step past form. These are the fields of knowing.

#### Open Sky I — Boundlessness of Space

Let the sense of the body-bound soften. Attend to “roomness”—the vast “around.” It unveils as unbounded, like looking out from the branches of Yggdrasil across all the worlds.

#### Open Sky II — Boundlessness of Knowing

See that it isn’t “space” you’re with, but the *knowing of space*. The field of heed itself feels endless, bright but edgeless.

#### Open Sky III — Nothingness

The field becomes a lack—no thing stands out. No objects to push or pull.

#### Open Sky IV — Neither Kenning Nor Unkenning

Here, heed is so thin it’s hard to say it’s here or not. This is a sharp knife, hard to balance on its point. Don’t strain; if it’s too airy, rest back in the Winter Sky.

Note: These skies are high. If they don’t open, keep tending the Halls of Form.

No hurry; *óðr* ripens with steady craft.

### Craft Notes

* Count if you must. Early on, count breaths 1–8, then drop counting once the mind stays.

* Lengthen sessions slowly. Begin with 15–25 minutes. When the stead feels welcoming, extend.

* Signal words. If you use inner cues, keep them spare: “touch,” “rest,” “wide,” “clear.”

* Afterwards. Rise like a warrior sheathing a blade. Note how equanimity influences speech and deed; that is the point—*frith* in the world.

## 

### Right Measure

This practice is a grindstone, not a trance-hunt. It grows steadiness, right kenning, and fit readiness for word and deed. Hold simple honor: truth, restraint, generosity, and oathkeeping. Power without right measure curdles; calm with right measure nourishes.

### Summary (for the wall)

1. Hallow the space.  
2. Sit upright.  
3. One spot, natural breath.  
4. Name the wight, return to breath.  
5. Let road-sign glow, don’t chase.  
6. Four Halls: spear-set joy → effortless joy → hearth-calm → winter-sky.  
7. Four Skies: boundless space → boundless knowing → nothingness → the almost-gone.  
8. Rise with frith; carry it into the day.

## The Lay of the Seven Wheels

Men and women are world-trees. In each of us runs a trunk-pole with seven bright wheels set along it. When we sit and heed the breath, these wheels wake, spin, and shine. This is no omen-hunt and no storm-raising; it is craft. We set our stead, straighten like Yggdrasil, and let the wind of the world (our breath) move through us. What follows is a way to *ken* these wheels and bring them into right measure.

### Hallowing the Stead

Mark a small vé. Sit steady—seat rooted, spine like a well-set mast. Hands easy. Heed the breath at one spot. When the mind runs off, name the wight, and come back. Plain work, again and again.

### The Seven

#### 1\) Root-Wheel — *The Deep Grip*

Stead: the base, where you meet the earth.  
 Feel: weight, stead-fastness, a low red glow like banked coals.  
 Word: “Here.”  
 Craft: Breathe down to the tail-stone. With each out-breath, let the body grow heavy and safe, like a longhouse set on bedrock. If fear-wights come, lay the feet firm and count slow from one to eight.  
 Right Use: food, roof, rest, work. Oath-keeping begins here.

#### 2\) Loins-Wheel — *The Mead-Flow*

Stead: the loins and womb-seat.  
 Feel: tide and warmth, a bright orange pour like fresh mead.  
 Word: “Let.”  
 Craft: Soften the belly. Breathe as if the tide itself were breathing you. If tightness grips, sway the hips a thumb’s breadth on the in-breath, still them on the out-breath.  
 Right Use: kin-love, bed-joy, make-craft, give-and-take. Keep bounds clean.

#### 3\) Gut-Knot Wheel — *The Sun-Haft*

Stead: the mid-gut, under the ribs.  
 Feel: heat, nerve, a yellow ring like the sun at noon.  
 Word: “Do.”  
 Craft: Draw breath to the gut-knot; on out-breath, let a warm ring spread. If will is weak, sit straighter and sharpen the in-breath; if anger flares, lengthen the out-breath and ease the jaw.  
 Right Use: set aims, bear hardship, steer yourself—no swagger, no crawl.

#### 4\) Heart-Wheel — *The Open Door*

Stead: breastbone’s middle.  
 Feel: lift and widen, a green meadow after rain.  
 Word: “Give.”  
 Craft: On each in-breath, feel the ribs rise like hall-doors opening; on each out-breath, wish well to all who share your fire—friend, foe, and the far-off you will never meet.  
 Right Use: troth, mercy, true speech warmed by care.

#### 5\) Throat-Wheel — *The Clear Reed*

Stead: hollow of the throat.  
 Feel: cool ring, blue note, a reed that carries sound true.  
 Word: “Speak.”  
 Craft: Let breath brush the throat like wind through rushes. If you choke on unsaid words, voice a low hum; if you babble, rest the tongue on the roof and breathe quiet.  
 Right Use: oaths said plain, songs kept true, silence held when wise.

#### 6\) Brow-Wheel — *The Far Sight*

Stead: between the brows.  
 Feel: keen aim, indigo dusk, a star seen sharp.  
 Word: “See.”  
 Craft: Soften the eyes; don’t drill holes in the dark. Let the field widen. If dream-smoke rises, note it and come back to the breath-light at the brow.  
 Right Use: right kenning, pattern-seeing without witch-chase.

#### 7\) Helm-Wheel — *The White Stillness*

Stead: the crown, where helm would sit.  
 Feel: hush, white-gold drift, snow under moon.  
 Word: “Be.”  
 Craft: Let breath grow fine. Sense a lightness above, like a hood of snow that does not chill. If pride creeps in, smile and feel the root again.  
 Right Use: even-mood, frith spread wide, no grasping for signs or wonders.

### 

### 

### How They Work Together

The wheels are not seven lone rings but one long spindle. When the root is firm, the loins can flow without flood. When the gut is steady, the heart can open without spilling. When the throat is clear, the brow can see without spell-drunkenness. When all are in right measure, the helm rests and the whole tree hums.

If one wheel overrules the rest, you will feel it: root without loins is hoard-sickness; loins without root is drift; gut without heart is harsh rule; heart without gut is wet straw; throat without brow is clamor; brow without throat is mute sight; helm without the rest is air-sickness. Bring each back to craft and breath.

### A Short Sitting

1. Hallow the stead. Sit like a spear set in good earth.

2. Heed the breath at the nose or navel.

3. On each out-breath, whisper the wheel’s word you are working: Here → Let → Do → Give → Speak → See → Be.

4. If smoke or storm rises, name the wight, smile, and start again.

5. End by feeling all seven at once: root heavy, loins flowing, gut warm, heart wide, throat clear, brow keen, helm still. Rise with frith.

### Right Measure

This telling is for steadiness, troth, and good deeds in the day. It is a grindstone, not a show. Keep your oaths, pay your due, feed who you can, and let your word be plain. When the wheels hum, the world hums with you. Carry that into work, hall, bed, and road.

# **Breath and Bridefire**

*a lay in fornyrðislag telling the yoking craft of twinfires*

**1\. HWÆT\!**

Hush the hall, hear a hearth-tale:  
 of bond made bright,  of breath well-bidden;  
 not sword’s swift song, nor sea-wolf’s rowing,  
 but craft of keeping, of kindled stillness.

**2\. The Meeting**

Siegfrid the farer, Brynhild the flame,  
 met under mountain, midnight’s hush.  
 Stars stood silent, snow-ridge shining;  
 wind was wary, world held breath.

He wore no war-gear, she bore no spear;  
 hand met heartward, eyes made troth.  
 “Let us lay,” said she, “no lie nor vaunt;  
 share a sharper path, sure as oath.”

**3\. The Cloaked One’s Counsel**

There came a watcher, a way-worn god,  
 hood on his head, one eye hidden.  
 “Hall-born lovers, heed my lesson:  
 bridle blood-tide, bind not love.

Hold fast, yet harmless; warm, yet watchful;  
 stay the spear’s run, still the rain.  
 Mead in the measure, mouth may savor—  
 but keep the cup’s clear rim unspilled.

Yoke your yearnings, join as journey;  
 row without riving, ride without rent.”  
 So spoke the grey one, then went to wind;  
 owl called over, ice creaked thin.

**4\. Setting the Stead**

They lit no loud fire, laid a low lamp;  
 spread a spare cloth, set the space.  
 Backs like birches, brow-branch tender,  
 root down, roof up: world-tree stance.

Palms found places, pulse like paddles;  
 breath, the boat-wind bore them inward.  
 “Count the ring,” said she, “the Sign-Ring;  
 ten staves standing, twinfires strung.

Name them softly— Void and All,  
 Rod and Gate, Twin and Ship,  
 Third and Loom, Forth and Fist.”  
 So did they whisper, sunwise, slow.

**5\. The Nine Walks**

“Nine are the night-ways,” noted the maiden;  
 “nine little goings for a great homecoming.  
 Root-wheel heavy, loins like tide;  
 gut like gold-fire, heart wide green;

throat a clear reed, brow far-seeing;  
 helm white-still, hall without storm.”  
 With each world-ward, warmth went brighter;  
 with each return, rest grew deep.

**6\. The Yoking**

Close came bodies, not clash nor rending;  
 thigh near thigh, though thought held reins.  
 Hands made harbors, heat moved kindly;  
 gaze met, given, glad and grave.

“Row not to ruin,” the rider murmured;  
 “oar without over, keep the keel true.”  
 “Strike not in storm,” said shield-wise woman;  
 “weave first the war-net, then will comes mild.”

Their breath braided, beats were brothers;  
 two streams teamed to a tide of one.  
 They kept the current, cool at crown,  
 warm at the wellspring, wide in the chest.

**7\. Restraint and Rising**

Hunger was horse, hot and haughty;  
 they bridled the beast with bright-borne care.  
 Not cutting the course, nor chilling the coals—  
 they stoked without spilling, stayed at shore.

Lids half-lowered, light grew golden;  
 nimble glow, a guest behind eyes.  
 Laughter like low bells lulled the strain;  
 joy rose, jangless, gentle, long.

“Here is the helm-road,” he heard within;  
 “gate without gripping, guard without grief.”  
 “Here is the ash-road,” she answered softly;  
 “give and get even, deal without debt.”

**8\. Trial of Flood**

Yet from the far side flood came thrumming;  
 river rushed red, rocks sang foam.  
 “Now is our knowing,” the night-bride whispered,  
 “to stand in stillness, not snap the dam.

Let water whirl, we watch, we welcome;  
 let heat heap high, hands remain true.”  
 Siegfrid was steadfast, songless and bright;  
 Brynhild bore blessing, breath like balm.

**9\. The Turning**

Then turned the torrent, tamed by tending;  
 fire found upward, fled to crown.  
 Back ran sweetness, breast grew boundless;  
 world-tree within them woke and hummed.

No drop was wasted, no deed undone;  
 wide was their weal, wordless and clean.  
 Ring of reckon rang in marrow—  
 twinfires twinned, time stood thin.

**10\. The Gift**

Morning met them, moss held dew;  
 sky, a clear shield, shone without cloud.  
 Grey-winged god, gone from sight,  
 left but a law, like a line on snow:

“Seed saved wisely sows the wide field;  
 might that is minded makes homes hale.  
 Measure is mead, more than madness;  
 love held holy lasts like stone.

Share without squandering, spare without starving;  
 keep oath and kindness, kindle and calm.”  
 They kissed with candor, kept their craft;  
 strode from the stead, strong and mild.

**11\. Skald’s Small Gloss**

Not battle is best, but balanced burning;  
 two made as one, yet each kept whole.  
 Hold back hurried harsh unheeding;  
 harrow the heart-field, harvest is sure.

River of rapture rises when bridled;  
 gate guards gladly gifts that abide.  
 Thus teaches the tale of twinfires wed:  
 love’s long alchemy— lawful, bright.

*So ends the lay of Breath and Bridefire,*

 *which wise folk sing not for show, but for stead:*

 *set a hearth in the heart, to bind strength with sweetness,*

 *and may your joy be just and long.*

# **The Cleaving of Cloud and the Rainbow-Road**

*a lay in fornyrðislag — of stark seeing and the four lamps, as an uphill going over Bifröst to Ásgarðr*

**1\. Proem**

Hush now, hall-men, heed a hard song:  
 not mead-lilt merry, nor love’s light art,  
 but grim ground-wisdom, grey as glacier—  
 a blade for binding, a breath for bare sky.

**2\. The Cleaving**

Came a lone walker, cloak like cloud;  
 Hrafn he was hight, hardy and spare.  
 He sought not seiðr, nor sign from staves,  
 but *truth untrimmed*, *thing as it is*.

Up the ice-edge, under bleak blue,  
 he found a fell-stone, flat and cold.  
 Set there his sitting, spine a spear;  
 hands like harbor, heart wind-still.

Thoughts, a throng, thick as ravens;  
 moods like mizzle, mutter and drift.  
 He drew no dirk to drive them off,  
 nor chased nor charmed— he *cut the claim*.

“Not mine, not me,” murmured the man;  
 “rise then, wane then; wide is the sky.”  
 Rope of ravel, writhe as you will—  
 the sword is seeing, the slice is *now*.

Thus was the cleaving: knot cut kindly;  
 no hate, no clinging, no hunted prey.  
 World stood wordless, wind without edge;  
 *Ginnung* opened, *gap without gash*.

**3\. The Watchman’s Word**

From the far snow-line a hornless watcher  
 came with calm steps, keen-eyed and still.  
 “Gate needs guarding,” the god-wise told him,  
 “but not with iron— *with even sight*.

Let all things come, let all things go;  
 leave them unlashed, let them be light.  
 Stand as Bifröst stands over blackness:  
 storm under, stars over— span without sway.”

Heimdall spoke thus, and the hush held.  
 Hrafn bowed barely, breathed and abided.

**4\. The Rainbow-Road Begins**

Night thinned slowly, north-sky silvered;  
 brow within brightened, bare of thought.  
 From the white still, whitings trembled—  
 seed-sparks simple, soft as dust.

“Lamp of First Light,” the looker knew it—  
 **the first lamp’s leavings:** little star-seeds.  
 No rush, no reaching; rest like ridge-snow,  
 let them arise and alight alone.

*Span One of Bifröst* blushed from the mist—  
 red foot forward, firm yet fine.

**5\. The Second Lamp — Nets and Needles of Ray**

Soon the small sparks sought out kinsmen;  
 ray met ray, a ring was woven.  
 Needles of brightness knitted the blue;  
 a net of daybreak narrowed the dark.

“Lamp of Netting,” named he softly—  
 **the second lamp’s** *spreading of sight*.  
 Do not draw lines, do not lay law—  
 see without seizing, stay with the weave.

*Span Two of Bifröst* burned in the east—  
 orange, amber, oath of dawn.

**6\. The Third Lamp — Hosts and Halls**

Web ripened, worlds came forth;  
 wheels within wheels, warm as summer.  
 Faces like fire-gold, fields like song;  
 swan-helmed maidens, men of light.

Halls hung high, hearths without smoke;  
 spears that were *saying*, shields that were *peace*.  
 All this arose, all out of *nothing*,  
 stood in stillness, shone, and smiled.

“Lamp of Hosts,” he hailed it gently—  
 knew **the third lamp’s** *culm and crown*.  
 Touch not nor take it; trust and tarry—  
 let the show sing, see through the shine.

*Span Three of Bifröst* flamed to green—  
 verdure of heart, vale and grove.

**7\. The Fourth Lamp — Fading Footprints**

Then the far marvels thinned like morning;  
 figures grew fine, fields turned sheer.  
 Sparks slid back to the bare brightness;  
 prints in fresh snowfall faded to white.

No loss, no lack— light in its *law*;  
 form fell friendly, *free to be none*.  
 This was the **fourth lamp**, *footsteps ending*,  
 all finds home in *wide awake*.

*Span Four of Bifröst* shone to blue—  
 deep of the dome, door without door.

**8\. The High Hall**

Over the river of red and green,  
 over the welkin of white and blue,  
 he came to *Ase-hall*, *Ásgarðr* gleaming—  
 not a place parted, but present here.

No roof nor ridge, no ring-wall needed;  
 all the ten thousand took one taste.  
 Oaths were open, iron idle;  
 war was a tale, wound was a word.

Allfather sat as a hush on a hill;  
 not far, not near— *knowing alone*.  
 He lifted no spear, he laid no doom;  
 the law was the looking, the love was the light.

**9\. The Return**

Down the bright bridge Hrafn went homeward,  
 not as he started, yet same in the bones.  
 Snow still biting, boots still brittle;  
 bread still needed, broom to wield.

But blade of seeing bit in the heartwood;  
 knot would not hold him fast.  
 When wrath would rise, he *rode it lightly*;  
 when joy would jangle, he *jogged with care*.

And when night wanted wonder and stars,  
 he sat once more and *saw through show*:  
 first small seedings, second the net;  
 third the high hosting, fourth the fade-home.

**10\. Skald’s Small Gloss**

*Cleaving* is cold work— cutting the clamor;  
 leave what leaves, let what comes.  
 Bridge-work is bright work— seeing the seeming;  
 do not drive, do not drown.

Four are the **lamps** on the rainbow-road:  
 first the **seed-sparks**, second the **web**;  
 third the **hosts**, fourth the **hush**.  
 Climb without clutching, cross without claim.

Thus is the *grim good* of ground and gaze;  
 Ásgarðr is always, over and in.  
 Bifröst is breath, brow, and being—  
 walk it wisely, wake and work.
